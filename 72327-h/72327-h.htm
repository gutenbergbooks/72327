<p><i>This book should perhaps have been “intituled”
Colonial Days in New Netherland,
for much of the life described herein was in
the days of Dutch rule. But it was New
Netherland for scarce half a century, and the
name is half-forgotten, though it remained,
both in outer life and in heart, a Dutch colonie,
even when the province was New York and
an English governor had control. In New
Netherland, as in every place where the Dutch
plant a colony, as in South Africa to-day,
Dutch ways, Dutch notions, the Dutch tongue
lingered long. To this day, Dutch influence
and Dutch traits, as well as Dutch names,
are ever present and are a force in New York
life.</i></p>

<p><i>Fair and beautiful lay the broad harbor
centuries ago before the eyes of Hendrick Hudson
and his sea-weary men; a “pleasant place”
was Manhattan; “’t lange eylandt was the pearel
of New Nederland;” the noble river,
the fertile shores, all seemed to the discoverers
and to the early colonists to smile a welcome
and a promise of happy homes. Still to-day
the bay, the islands, the river, the shores welcome
with the same promise. In grateful
thanks for that welcome and for the fulfilment
of that promise of old,—for more years of
life in New York than were spent in my birth-place
in New England,—and in warm affection
for my many friends of Dutch descent,
have I—to use the words of Rabelais—“adjoined
these words and testimony for the
honour I bear to antiquity.”</i></p>

<hr class="r5">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br><span class="small">THE LIFE OF A DAY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At the first break of day, every spring and
summer morn, the quiet Dutch sleepers in
the old colonial town of Albany were roused
by three loud blasts of a horn sounded far
and wide by a sturdy cow-herd; and from
street and dooryard came in quick answer the
jingle-jangle, the klingle-klangle of scores of
loud-tongued brass and iron bells which hung
from the necks of steady-going hungry Dutch
cows who followed the town-herder forth each
day to pastures green.</p>

<p>On the broad town-commons or the fertile
river-meadows Uldrick Heyn and his “chosen
proper youngster,” his legally appointed aid,
watched faithfully all day long their neighbors’
cattle; and as honest herdsmen earned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
well their sea-want and their handsel of butter,
dallying not in tavern, and drinking not of
wine, as they were sternly forbidden by the
<i>schepens</i>, until when early dews were falling
they quit their meadow grasses mellow, for
“at a quarter of an hour before the sun goes
down the cattle shall be delivered at the
church.” Thence the patient kine slowly
wandered or were driven each to her own
home-stall, her protecting cow-shed.</p>

<p>In New Amsterdam the town’s cow-herd
was Gabriel Carpsey; and when his day’s
work was done, he walked at sunset through
the narrow lanes and streets of the little settlement,
sounding at each dooryard Gabriel’s
horn, a warning note of safe return and
milking-time.</p>

<p>Until mid-November did the morning cow-horn
waken the burghers and their <i>vrouws</i> at
sunrise; and when with cold winter the horn
lay silent, they must have sorely missed their
unfailing eye-opener.</p>

<p>Scarce had the last cow departed in the
early morn from her master’s dooryard,
before there rose in the gray light from each
vast-throated chimney throughout the little
town a faint line of pale, wavering smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
blown up in increasing puffs with skilful
bellows from last night’s brands upon the
hearth. And quickly the slender line of
smoke grew and grew to a great cloud over
each steep-roofed house, and soon with the
smell of the burning brush and light pine
that were coaxing into hot flames the sturdy
oak back and fore logs, were borne forth
also appetizing odors of breakfast to greet
the early morn, telling of each thrifty <i>huys-vrouw</i>
who within the walls of her cheerful
kitchen was cooking a good solid Dutch
breakfast for her <i>mann</i>.</p>

<p>Cans of buttermilk or good beer, brewed
perhaps by the patroon, washed down this
breakfast of suppawn and rye-bread and
grated cheese and sausage or head-cheese;
beer there was in plenty, in ankers, even in
tuns, in every household. Soon <i>mynheer</i> filled
his long pipe with native tobacco, and departed
with much deliberation of movement;
a sturdy, honest figure, of decent carriage,
neatly and soberly and warmly clad, with
thrift and prosperity and contentment showing
in every curve of his too-well-rounded
figure. Adown the narrow street he paused
to trade in peltries or lumber, if he were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
middle-aged and well-to-do; and were he
sturdy and young, he threshed grain on the
barn-floor, or ground corn at the windmill,
or felled wood on the hillside; or perchance,
were he old or young, he fished in the river
all day long,—a truly dignified day’s work,
meet for any sober citizen, one requiring
much judgment and skill and reflection.</p>

<p>And as he fished, again he smoked, and
ever he smoked. “The Dutch are obstinate
and incessant smokers,” chronicles the English
clergyman Wolley, Chaplain of Fort
James, New York, in 1678, “whose diet, especially
of the boorish sort, being sallets and
brawn and very often picked buttermilk,
require the use of that herb to keep their
phlegm from coagulating and curdling.”
The word “boorish” was not a term of reproach,
nor was the frequent appellation
“Dutch bore,” over which some historians of
the colony have seen fit to make merry, both
boor and bore meaning simply <i>boer</i>, or farmer.
“Knave meant once no more than lad; villain
than peasant; a boor was only a farmer; a
varlet was but a serving-man; a churl but a
strong fellow.”</p>

<p>What fishing was to the goodman of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
house, knitting was to the goodwife,—a soothing,
monotonous occupation, ever at hand,
ever welcome, ever useful. Why, the family
could scarce be clothed in comfort without
these clicking needles! A goodly supply of
well-knit, carefully dyed stockings was the
housekeeper’s pride; and well they might
be, for little were they hidden. The full
knee-breeches of father and son displayed
above the buckled shoes a long expanse of
sturdy hosiery, and the short petticoats of
mother and daughter did not hide the scarlet
clocks of their own making. From the moment
when the farmer gave the fleece of the
sheep into the hands of his women-kind, every
step of its transformation into stockings (except
the knitting) was so tiresome and tedious
that it is wearying even to read of it,—cleaning,
washing, dyeing, carding, greasing, rolling,
spinning, winding, rinsing, knotting,—truly
might the light, tidy, easy knitting seem
a pastime.</p>

<p>The endless round of “domesticall kind of
drudgeries that women are put to,” as Howell
says, would prove a very full list when made
out from the life of one of these colonial
housewives. It seems to us, of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
labor-saved and drudgery-void days, a truly
overwhelming list; but the Dutch <i>huys-vrouw</i>
did not stagger under the burden, nor
shrink from it, nor, indeed, did she deem any
of her daily work drudgery. The sense of
thrift, of plenty, of capability, of satisfaction,
was so strong as to overcome the distaste to
the labor of production.</p>

<p>She had as a recreation, a delight, the
care of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A garden through whose latticed gates</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The imprisoned pinks and tulips gazed,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">a trim, stiff little garden, which often graced
the narrow front dooryard; a garden perhaps
of a single flower-bed surrounded by
aromatic herbs for medicinal and culinary
use, but homelike and beloved as such gardens
ever are, and specially beloved as such
gardens are by the Dutch. Many were the
tulip bulbs and “coronation” pink roots that
had been brought or sent over from Holland,
and were affectionately cherished as reminders
of the far-away Fatherland. The enthusiastic
traveller Van der Donck wrote that by
1653 Netherlanders had already blooming in
their American garden-borders “white and red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
roses, stock roses, cornelian roses, eglantine,
jenoffelins, gillyflowers, different varieties of
fine tulips, crown-imperials, white lilies, anemones,
bare-dames, violets, marigolds, summer-sots,
clove-trees.” Garden-flowers of native
growth were “sunflowers, red and yellow
lilies, morning-stars, bell-flowers, red and
white and yellow maritoffles.” I do not know
what all these “flower-gentles” were, but
surely it was no dull array of blossoms; nor
were their glories dimmed because they
opened ever by the side of the homely cabbages
and lettuce, the humble cucumbers and
beans, that were equally beloved and tended
by the garden-maker.</p>

<p>And the housewife had her beloved and
homelike poultry. Flocks of snowy geese
went waddling slowly down the town streets,
seeking the water-side; giving rich promise of
fat holiday dinners and plumper and more
plentiful feather-beds; comfortable and thriving
looking as geese always are, and ever
indicative of prosperous, thrifty homes,
they comported well with the pipe-smoking
burgher and his knitting <i>huys-vrouw</i> and
their homelike dwelling.</p>

<p>There was one element of beauty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
picturesqueness which idealized the little
town and gave it an added element of life,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“Over all and everywhere</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sails of windmills sink and soar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like wings of sea-gulls on the shore.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The beauty of the windmills probably was
not so endearing to the settlers as their
homelikeness. They made the new strange
land and the new little towns seem like the
Fatherland. The Indians greatly feared
them; as one chronicler states, “they durst
not come near their long arms and big teeth
biting the corn in pieces.” Last, and not
least in the minds of the thrifty Dutch, the
windmills helped to turn to profit the rich
harvests of grain which were the true foundation
of the colony’s prosperity,—not the
rich peltries of beaver, as was at first boastfully
vaunted by the fur-traders.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, the day’s work was
ended, and a neighborly consultation and
exchange of greetings formed the day’s recreation.
The burgher went to the little
market-house, and with his neighbors and
a few chance travellers, such as the skippers
on the river-sloops, he smoked again his long
pipe and talked over the weighty affairs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the <i>colonie</i>. In the summer-time goodman
and goodwife both went from stoop to stoop
of the close-gathered houses, for a <i>klappernye</i>,
or chat all together. This was a feature of
the colony, architectural and social, and noted
by all travellers,—“the benches at the door,
on which the old carls sit and smoke.” Here
the goodwife recounted the simple events
of the day,—the number of skeins of yarn
she had spun; the yards of linen she had
woven; the doings of the dye-pot; the
crankiness of the churning, to which she
had sung her churning charm,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Buitterchee, buitterchee, comm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alican laidlechee tubichee vall.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps she told her <i>commeres</i>, her gossips,
of a fresh suspicion of a betrothal, or perhaps
sad news of a sick neighbor or a funeral.
This was never scandal, for each one’s affairs
were every one’s affairs; in the weal or woe
of one the whole community joined, and in
many of the influences or effects of that weal
or woe all had a part. It was noted by historians
that the Dutch were most open in
discussion of all the doings of the community,
and had no dread of publicity of every-day
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Of this habit of colonial neighborliness,
Mrs. Anne Grant wrote in her “Memoir of
an American Lady”—Madam Schuyler—from
contemporary knowledge of early life in
Albany:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The life of new settlers in a situation like this,
when the very foundations of society were to be
laid, was a life of exigencies. Every individual
took an interest in the general welfare, and contributed
their respective shares of intelligence and sagacity
to aid plans that embraced important objects
relative to the common good. This community
seemed to have a common stock, not only of sufferings
and enjoyments, but of information and ideas.”</p>
</div>

<p>When the sun was setting and the cows
came home, the family gathered on stools
and forms around the well-supplied board,
and a plentiful supper of suppawn and milk
and a sallet filled the hungry mouths, and
was eaten from wooden trenchers and pewter
porringers with pewter or silver spoons. The
night had come; here were shelter and a
warm hearthstone, and, though in the new
wild world, it was in truth a home.</p>

<p>Sometimes, silently smoking with the man
of the house, there sat in the winter <i>schemer-licht</i>,
the shadow-light or gloaming, around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the great glowing hearth, a group of dusky
picturesque forms,—friendly Mohawks, who,
when their furs were safely sold, could be
welcomed, and were ever tolerated and harbored
by the kindly Swannekins; and as
the shadows gathered into the “fore-night,”
and the fierce wind screamed down the great
chimney and drew out into the darkness long
tongues of orange and scarlet flames from
the oak and hickory fires (burning, says one
early traveller, half up the chimney), there
was homely comfort within, and peace in the
white man’s wigwam.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What matter how the North-wind raved,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blow high, blow low, not all its snow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could quench that hearth-fire’s ruddy glow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the blanketed squaw felt in her savage
breast the spirit of that home, and gently
nursed her swaddled pappoose; and the
silent <i>Wilden</i>, ever smoking, listened to the
Dutch <i>huys-moeder</i>, who, undressing little
Hybertje and Jan and Goosje for their long
night’s sleep, sang to them the nursery song
of the Hollanders, of the Fatherland:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Trip a troup a tronjes,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">So groot myn klein poppetje was.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

sang to Kriss-Kringle:—</p>

<p>Then the warming-pan was filled with hot
coals, and thrust warily between the ice-cold
sheets of the children’s beds, and perhaps
they were given a drink of mulled cider or
simmering beer; and scarcely were they sleeping
in their warm flannel <i>cosyntjes</i>, or night-caps
with long capes, when the curfew rang
out from the church belfry. It was eight
o’clock,—<i>’t Is tijdt te bedde te gaen</i>. The
housewife carefully covered “the dull red
brands with ashes over” for the fire of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
morrow, and went to bed. The “tap-toes”
sounded from the fort, and every house was
silent.</p>

<p>And as the honest <i>mynheer</i> and his good
<i>vrouw</i> slept warmly in their fireside alcove,
and softly between their great feather-beds, so
they also slept serenely; for they were not left
unprotected from marauding Indian or Christian,
nor unwatched by the ever-thoughtful
town authorities. Through the little town
marched boldly every night a sturdy <i>kloppermann</i>,
or rattle-watch, with strong staff
and brass-bound hourglass and lighted lanthorn;
and, best of all, he bore a large <i>klopper</i>,
or rattle, which he shook loudly and reassuringly
at each door all through the dark
hours of the night, “from nine o’clock to
break of the day,” to warn both housekeepers
and thieves that he was near at hand; and as
was bidden by the worshipful <i>schepens</i>, he
called out what o’clock, and what weather;—and
thus guarded, let us leave them sleeping,
these honest Dutch home-folk, as they
have now slept for centuries in death, waiting
to hear called out to them with clear voice
“at break of the day” from another world,
“A fair morning, and all’s well.”</p>

<p>As soon as the little American baby was
born in New Netherland, he was taken to the
church by his Dutch papa, and with due array
of sponsors was christened by the domine
from the <i>doop-becken</i>, or dipping-bowl, in the
Dutch Reformed Church. New Yorkers had
a beautiful silver <i>doop-becken</i> in 1695, and the
church on the corner of Thirty-Eighth Street
and Madison Avenue has it still. It was
made in Amsterdam from silver coin and
ornaments brought by the good folk of the
Garden Street Church as offerings. For it
Domine Henricus Selyns, “of nimble faculty,”
then minister of that church, and formerly
of Breuckelen, and the first poet of
Brooklyn, wrote these pious and graceful
verses, which were inscribed on the bowl:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which translated reads:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Do not put your hope in simple water alone, ’twere better never to be born.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>This christening was the sole social or
marked event of the <i>kindeken’s</i> infancy, and
little else do we know of his early life. He
ate and slept, as do all infants. In cradles
slept these children of the Dutch,—deep-hooded
cradles to protect from the chill
draughts of the poorly heated houses. In
cradles of birch bark the Albany babies slept;
and pretty it was to see the fat little Dutch-men
sleeping in those wildwood tributes of
the Indian mothers’ skill to the children of
the men who had driven the children of the
redmen from their homes.</p>

<p>Children were respectful, almost cowed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
in their bearing to their parents, and were
enjoined by ministers and magistrates to
filial obedience. When the government left
the Dutch control and became English, the
Calvinistic sternness of laws as to obedience
to parents in maturer years which was seen in
New England was also found in New York.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If any Child or Children, above sixteen years of
age, and of Sufficient understanding, shall smite their
Natural Father or Mother, unless provoked and
forct for their selfe preservation from Death or
Mayming, at the Complaint of the said Father or
Mother, and not otherwise, they being Sufficient
witness thereof, that Child, or those Children so
offending shall be put to Death.”</p>
</div>

<p>A few prim little letters of English children
have survived the wear and tear of
years, and still show us in their pretty wording
the formal and respectful language of the
times. Martha Bockée Flint, in that interesting
and valuable book, “Early Long
Island,” gives this letter written to Major
Ephenetus Platt “at Huntting-town” by a
little girl eleven years old:—</p>

<p>In the Lloyd Collections is a charming
little letter from another Long Island miss,
ten years of age. The penmanship is elegant
and finished, as was that of her elders
at that date.</p>

<p>We have, however, scant sources from
which to learn of the life of children in colonial
New York. No diarist of Pepysian
minuteness tells of the children of New
Netherland as does the faithful Samuel Sewall
of those of New England; no collections of
letters such as the Winthrop Papers and
others recount the various items of domestic
life. There are none of the pious and garrulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
writings of ministers such as Cotton
Mather, who in diary and various literary
compositions give another side of their life.
We have no such messages from the colonial
Dutch. In whatever depended on the use
of “a flourit pen,” posterity is neither richer
nor wiser for the Dutch settlers having lived.
Nor were their English successors much
fonder of literary composition. Nothing but
formal records of churches, of courts, of business
life, offer to us any pages for study and
drawing of inference. And from these records
the next hint of the life of these colonial
children, sad to relate, is to their discredit.
The pragmatic magistrates kept up a steady
prying and bullying over them. In New
Orange, in 1673, “if any children be caught
on the street playing, racing, and shouting
previous to the termination of the last preaching,
the officers of justice may take their hat
or upper garment, which shall not be restored
to the parents until they have paid a fine of
two guilders,” which, we may be sure, would
insure the miserable infants summary punishment
on arriving home.</p>

<p>Matters were no better in New Amsterdam.
One amusing complaint was brought up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
against “y<sup>e</sup> wretched boys” of that settlement,
and by one high in authority, Schout
De Sille. One of his duties was to patrol the
town of New Amsterdam at night to see that
all was peaceful as befitted a town which was
the daughter of the Dutch government. But
the poor <i>schout</i> did not find his evening
stroll altogether a happy one. He complained
that the dogs set upon him, and that
tantalizing boys shouted out “The Indians!”
at him from behind trees and fences,—which
must have startled him sorely, and have been
most unpleasantly suggestive in those days
of Indian horrors; and his chief complaint
was that there was “much cutting of
hoekies” by the boys,—which means, I
fancy, playing of tricks, of jokes, of <i>hoaxes</i>,
such as were played on Hock-day in England,
or perhaps “playing hookey,” as American
boys of to-day have been known to do.</p>

<p>As years passed on, I fear some of these
young Dutch-Americans were sad rogues.
They sore roused the wrath of Albany legislators,
as is hereby proven:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas y<sup>e</sup> children of y<sup>e</sup> s<sup>d</sup> city do very unorderly
to y<sup>e</sup> shame and scandall of their parents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>ryde down y<sup>e</sup> hills in y<sup>e</sup> streets of the s<sup>d</sup> city with
small and great slees on the lord day and in the
week by which many accidents may come, now for
pventing y<sup>e</sup> same it is hereby publishd and declard
y<sup>t</sup> it shall and may be lawful for any Constable in
this City or any other person or persons to take any
slee or slees from all and every such boys and girls
rydeing or offering to ryde down any hill within y<sup>e</sup>
s<sup>d</sup> city and breake any slee or slees in pieces.
Given under our hands and seals in Albany y<sup>e</sup> 22th
of December in 12th year of Her Maj’s reign Anno
Domini 1713.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1728 Albany boys and girls still were
hectored, still were fined by the bullying
Albany constable for sliding down the
alluringly steep Albany streets on “sleds,
small boards, or otherwise.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, writing of about the year
1765, speaks of the custom of coasting, but
not of the legislation against it, and gives a
really delightful picture of coasting-joys,
which apparently were then partaken of only
by boys. The <i>schepens</i> and their successors
the constables, joy-destroying Sivas,
had evidently succeeded in wresting this
pleasure from the girls.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In town all the boys were extravagantly fond of
a diversion that to us would appear a very odd and
childish one. The great street of the town sloped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
down from the hill on which the fort stood, towards
the river; between the buildings was an unpaved
carriage-road, the foot-path beside the houses being
the only part of the street which was paved. In
winter the sloping descent, continued for more than
a quarter of a mile, acquired firmness from the frost,
and became very slippery. Then the amusement
commenced. Every boy and youth in town, from
eight to eighteen, had a little low sledge, made with
a rope like a bridle to the front, by which it could
be dragged after one by the hand. On this one or
two at most could sit, and this sloping descent being
made as smooth as a looking-glass, by sliders’
sledges, etc., perhaps a hundred at once set out
from the top of this street, each seated in his little
sledge with the rope in his hand, which, drawn to
the right or left, served to guide him. He pushed
it off with a little stick, as one would launch a boat;
and then, with the most astonishing velocity, precipitated
by the weight of the owner, the little
machine glided past, and was at the lower end of
the street in an instant. What could be so delightful
in this rapid and smooth descent I could never
discover; though in a more retired place, and on a
smaller scale, I have tried the amusement; but to a
young Albanian, sleighing, as he called it, was one
of the first joys of life, though attended by the
drawback of walking to the top of the declivity,
dragging his sledge every time he renewed his
flight, for such it might well be called. In the
managing this little machine some dexterity was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
necessary: an unskilful Phaeton was sure to fall.
The conveyance was so low that a fall was attended
with little danger, yet with much disgrace, for an
universal laugh from all sides assailed the fallen
charioteer. This laugh was from a very full chorus,
for the constant and rapid succession of this procession,
where every one had a brother, lover, or
kinsman, brought all the young people in town to
the porticos, where they used to sit wrapt in furs till
ten or eleven at night, engrossed by this delectable
spectacle. I have known an Albanian, after residing
some years in Britain, and becoming a polished
fine gentleman, join the sport and slide down with
the rest.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Grant tells of another interesting and
unusual custom of the children of Albany:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The children of the town were divided into
companies, as they called them, from five to six
years of age, until they became marriageable. How
those companies first originated, or what were their
exact regulations, I cannot say; though I, belonging
to none, occasionally mixed with several, yet
always as a stranger, notwithstanding that I spoke
their current language fluently. Every company
contained as many boys as girls. But I do not
know that there was any limited number; only this
I recollect, that a boy and girl of each company,
who were older, cleverer, or had some other pre-eminence
among the rest were called heads of the
company, and as such were obeyed by the others....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Children of different ages in the same family
belonged to different companies. Each company
at a certain time of the year went in a body to
gather a particular kind of berries to the hill. It
was a sort of annual festival attended with religious
punctuality. Every company had a uniform for
this purpose; that is to say, very pretty light baskets
made by the Indians, with lids and handles,
which hung over one arm, and were adorned with
various colors. Every child was permitted to
entertain the whole company on its birthday, and
once besides, during winter and spring. The master
and mistress of the family always were bound to
go from home on these occasions, while some old
domestic was left to attend and watch over them,
with an ample provision of tea, chocolate, preserved
and dried fruits, nuts and cakes of various kinds, to
which was added cider or a syllabub; for these
young friends met at four and amused themselves
with the utmost gayety and freedom in any way
their fancy dictated.”</p>
</div>

<p>From all the hints and facts which I have
obtained, through letters, diaries, church
and court records, of child-life in any of the
colonies or provinces among English, German,
Swedish, or Dutch settlers, I am sure
these Albany young folk were the most
favored of their time. I find no signs of such
freedom in any other town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>It has been asserted that in every town in
New York which was settled under the
Dutch, a school was established which was
taught by a competent teacher who received a
small salary from the government, in addition
to his other emoluments; and that after
the reign of the English, begun in 1664, this
public salary ceased, and many of the towns
were schoolless.</p>

<p>This statement is not confirmed by a letter
of Domine Megapolensis written from Albany
in 1657. He says plainly that only Manhattan,
Beverwyck, and Fort Casimir had schoolmasters,
and he predicts, as a result, “ignorance,
a ruined youth, and bewilderment of
men’s minds.” Other authorities, such as
Mr. Teunis G. Bergen, state that this liberality
where it existed should be accredited to
the Dutch church, not the Dutch state, or
Dutch West India Company. In truth, it
was all one matter. The church was an
essential power in the government of New
Netherland, as it was in Holland; hence the
West India Company and the Classis of
Amsterdam conjoined in sending domines
with the supply of burgomasters, and likewise
furnished school-teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>When Wouter van Twiller arrived in 1633
with the first military garrison for New Amsterdam,
he brought also envoys of religion
and learning,—Domine Everardus Bogardus
and the first pedagogue, Adam Roelandsen.
Master Roelandsen had a schoolroom assigned
to him, and he taught the youthful New Amsterdamites
for six years, when he resigned
his position, and was banished from the
town and went up the river to Renssellaerwyck.
I fear he was not a very reputable
fellow, “people did not speak well of him;”
and he in turn was sued for slander; and
some really sad scandals were told about
him, both in and out of court. And some
folk have also made very merry over the fact
that he took in washing, which was really
one of the best things we know about him,
for it was not at all a disreputable nor unmanly
calling in those times. It doubtless
proved a very satisfactory source of augmentation
of the wavering school-salary, in those
days of vast quarterly or semi-annual washings
and great <i>bleeckeryen</i>, or laundries,—which
his probably was, since his bills were
paid by the year.</p>

<p>A carpenter, Jan Cornelissen, tired of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
tools and trade, left Renssellaerwyck upon
hearing of the vacant teacher’s chair in New
Amsterdam, went down the river to Manhattan,
and in turn taught the school for ten
years. Jan was scarcely more reputable than
Adam. He lay drunk for a month at a time,
and was incorrigibly lazy,—so aggravated
Albanians wrote of him. But any one was
good enough to teach school. Neither Jan
nor Adam was, however, a convicted and banished
felon, as were many Virginian schoolmasters.</p>

<p>This drunken schoolmaster was only the
first of many. Until this century, the bane
of pedagogy in New York was rum. A chorus
of colonial schoolmasters could sing, in the
words of Goldsmith,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let schoolmasters puzzle their brains</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With grammar and nonsense and learning;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good liquor I stoutly maintain</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gives genius a better discerning.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Occasionally a certain schoolmaster would
be specified in a school-circular as a sober
man; proving by the mentioning the infrequency
of the qualification.</p>

<p>As the colony grew, other teachers were
needed. Governor Stuyvesant sent to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Classis of Amsterdam for “a pious, well-qualified,
and diligent schoolmaster.” William
Vestens crossed the ocean in answer to
this appeal, and taught for five years in one
room in New York; while Jan de la Montagne,
with an annual salary of two hundred
florins, taught at the Harberg—later the
Stadt-Huys—and occupied the position of
the first public-school teacher.</p>

<p>For years a project of building a schoolhouse
was afloat. A spot had been fixed upon,
and some money subscribed. In 1649 the
Commonalty represented to the West India
Company that “the plate was a long time
passed around for a common school which
has been built with words, for as yet the first
stone is not laid.” In response to this
appeal, a schoolhouse was at last erected.
Still another school was opened by Master
Hoboocken, who taught in the Governors’
bowery, where Dutch-American children were
already beginning to throng the green lanes
and by-ways. He was succeeded by Evert
Pietersen, who was engaged as “Consoler of
the Sick, Chorister and Schoolmaster;” and
all persons without distinction were ordered
not to molest, disturb, or ridicule him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
either of these offices, but to “deliver him
from every painful sensation.” Many of
the other schoolmasters had filled similar
offices in the church and community.</p>

<p>This public school, maintained with such
difficulty and so many rebuffs through these
early days, was successfully continued by the
Collegiate Dutch Church after the English
possession of New York; and it still exists
and flourishes, as does the church. This
should be a matter of civic pride to every
New Yorker. The history of that school has
been carefully written, and is most interesting
to read.</p>

<p>Many other teachers were licensed to give
private lessons, but these public and private
schools did not satisfy ambitious New Yorkers.
A strong longing was felt in New
Amsterdam for a Latin School. A characteristic
petition was sent by the burgomasters
and <i>schepens</i> to the West India Company:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is represented that the youth of this place
and the neighborhood are increasing in number
gradually, and that most of them can read and
write, but that some of the citizens and inhabitants
would like to send their children to a school the
principal of which understands Latin, but are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
able to do so without sending them to New England;
furthermore, they have not the means to hire
a Latin schoolmaster expressly for themselves from
New England, and therefore they ask that the West
India Company will send out a fit person as Latin
schoolmaster, not doubting that the number of persons
who will send their children to such a teacher
will from year to year increase until an academy
shall be formed whereby this place to great splendour
will have attained, for which, next to God, the
Honorable Company which shall have sent such
teacher here shall have laud and praises. For our
own part we shall endeavor to find a fit place in
which the schoolmaster shall hold his school.”</p>
</div>

<p>The desired “gerund-grinder”—to use
Tristram Shandy’s word—was soon despatched.
The fit place was found,—a good
house with a garden. He was promised an
annual salary of five hundred guilders. Each
scholar also was to pay six guilders per quarter.
But Dr. Curtius’s lines fell in difficult
places; he could keep no order among his
Latin-school pupils, those bad young New
Amsterdamites, who “beat each other and tore
the clothes from each other’s backs,” and he
complained he was restrained by the orders
of parents from properly punishing them.
(I may say here that I have not found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
New York schoolmasters were ever as cruel
as were those of New England.) A graver
matter to honest colonists was his charging a
whole beaver-skin too much per quarter to
some scholars, and soon he was packed back
to Holland. His successor, a young man of
twenty-two, who had been tutor to Stuyvesant’s
sons, had better luck, better control,
and a better academy; and New Amsterdam
to “great splendour was attained,” having
pupils from other towns and colonies, even
from so far away as Virginia.</p>

<p>The relations between church, school, and
state were equally close throughout all New
Netherland. Thus, in 1661, Governor Stuyvesant
recommended Charles De Bevoise as
schoolmaster for Brooklyn; and when Domine
Henricus Selyns left the Brooklyn church,
Schoolmaster De Bevoise was ordered to
read prayers and sermons, “to read a postille”
every Sabbath until another minister
was obtained. He was also a <i>krankebesoecker</i>,
or comforter of the sick. Even after the
establishment of English rule in the colony,
the connection of Dutch church and school
was equally close. When Johannis Van
Eckellen was engaged by the Consistory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
the Dutch church in Flatbush in October,
1682, as a schoolmaster for the town, it was
under this extremely interesting and minute
contract, which, translated, reads thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Articles of Agreement</span> made with Johannis
Van Eckellen, schoolmaster and clerk of the church
at Flatbush.</p>

<p>1st. The school shall begin at eight o’clock in
the morning, and go out at eleven o’clock. It
shall begin again at one o’clock and end at four
o’clock. The bell shall be rung before the school
begins.</p>

<p>2nd. When the school opens, one of the children
shall read the morning prayer, as it stands in
the catechism, and close with the prayer before
dinner. In the afternoon it shall begin with the
prayer after dinner, and close with the evening
prayer. The evening school shall begin with the
Lord’s Prayer, and close by singing a Psalm.</p>

<p>3rd. He shall instruct the children in the
common prayers and the questions and answers
of the catechism, on Wednesdays and Saturdays,
to enable them to say their catechism on Sunday
afternoons in the church before the afternoon service,
otherwise on the Monday following, at which
the schoolmaster shall be present. He shall demean
himself patient and friendly towards the
children in their instruction, and be active and
attentive to their improvement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
4th. He shall be bound to keep his school
nine months in succession, from September to
June, one year with another, or the like period of
time for a year, according to the agreement with
his predecessor, he shall, however, keep the school
nine months, and always be present himself.</p>


<h3>CHURCH SERVICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Art.</span> 1st. He shall be chorister of the church,
ring the bell three times before service, and
read a chapter of the Bible in the church, between
the second and third ringing of the bell; after the
third ringing he shall read the ten commandments
and the twelve articles of Faith, and then set the
Psalm. In the afternoon, after the third ringing
of the bell, he shall read a short chapter, or one of
the Psalms of David, as the congregation are
assembling. Afterwards he shall again set the
Psalm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art.</span> 2nd. When the minister shall preach at
Brooklyn or New Utrecht, he shall be bound to
read twice before the congregation a sermon from
the book used for the purpose. The afternoon
sermon will be on the catechism of Dr. Vander
Hagen, and thus he shall follow the turns of the
minister. He shall hear the children recite the
questions and answers of the catechism, on that
Sunday, and he shall instruct them. When the
minister preaches at Flatlands, he shall perform
the like service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art.</span> 3rd. He shall provide a basin of water
for the baptisms, for which he shall receive twelve
stuyvers, in wampum, for every baptism, from the
parents or sponsors. He shall furnish bread and
wine for the communion, at the charge of the
church. He shall furnish the minister, in writing,
the names and ages of the children to be baptized,
together with the names of the parents and sponsors;
he shall also serve as a messenger for the
consistories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art.</span> 4th. He shall give the funeral invitations,
and toll the bells, for which service he shall receive,
for persons of fifteen years of age and upwards,
twelve guilders; and for persons under fifteen, eight
guilders. If he shall invite out of the town, he shall
receive three additional guilders for every town;
and if he shall cross the river to New York, he shall
have four guilders more.</p>


<h3>SCHOOL MONEY.</h3>

<p>He shall receive for a speller or reader in the
day school three guilders for a quarter, and for a
writer four guilders.</p>

<p>In the evening school, he shall receive for a
speller or reader four guilders for a quarter, and

<p>Truly we have through this contract—to
any one with any powers of historic imagination—a
complete picture of the duties of
the schoolmaster of that day.</p>

<p>When the English came in power in 1664,
some changes were made in matters of education
in New York, but few changes in
any of the conditions in Albany. Governor
Nicholls, on his first visit up the river, made
one significant appointment,—that of an
English schoolmaster. This was the Englishman’s
license to teach:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas the teaching of the English Tongue is
necessary in this Government; I have, therefore,
thought fitt to give License to John Shutte to bee
the English Schoolmaster at Albany: and upon
condition that the said John Shutte shall not demand
any more wages from each Scholar than is
given by the Dutch to their Dutch Schoolmasters.
I have further granted to the said John Shutte that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
hee shall bee the only English Schoolmaster at
Albany.”</p>
</div>

<p>The last clause of this license seems superfluous;
for it is very doubtful whether there
was for many years any other English teacher
who eagerly sought what was so far from being
either an onerous or lucrative position.
Many generations of Albany children grew to
manhood ere the Dutch schoolmasters found
their positions supererogatory.</p>

<p>Women-teachers and girl-scholars were of
small account in New York in early days.
Girls did, however, attend the public schools.
We find Matthew Hillyer, in 1676, setting
forth in New York that he “hath kept school
for children of both sexes for two years
past to satisfaction.” Dame-schools existed,
especially on Long Island, where English
influences and Connecticut emigration obtained.
In Flushing Elizabeth Cowperthwait
was reckoned with in 1681 for
“schooling and diet for children;” and in
1683 she received for thirty weeks’ schooling,
of “Martha Johanna,” a scarlet petticoat,—truly
a typical Dutch payment. A school
bill settled by John Bowne in Flushing in
1695 shows that sixpence a week was paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
to the teacher for each scholar who learned
reading, while writing and ciphering cost
one shilling twopence a week. This, considering
the usual wages and prices of the
times, was fair pay enough.</p>

<p>We have access to a detailed school bill of
the Lloyd boys in 1693, but they were sent
away from their Long Island home at Lloyd’s
Neck to New England; so the information
is of no value as a record of a New York
school; but one or two of these items are
curious enough to be recounted:—</p>

<p>Wormwood and rhubarb for the boys and a

the wine was but tenpence a bottle, seems
somewhat unfair discrimination.</p>

<p>There is an excellent list of the clothing
of a New York schoolboy of eleven
years given in a letter written by Fitz-John
Winthrop to Robert Livingstone in 1690.
This young lad, John Livingstone, had also
been in school in New England. The
“account of linen &amp; clothes” shows him to
have been very well dressed. It reads

<p>In 1685 Goody Davis taught a dame-school
at Jamaica; and in 1687 Rachel Spencer died
in Hempstead, and her name was recorded
as that of a schoolmistress. In 1716, at the
Court of Sessions in Westchester, one of the
farm-wives, Dame Shaw, complained that “a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
travelling woman who came out of y<sup>e</sup> Jerseys
who kept school at several places in Rye
parish, hath left with her a child eleven
months old, for which she desires relief from
the parish.”</p>

<p>It is easy to fancy a vague romance through
this short record of the life of this nameless
“travelling woman” who, babe in arms,
earned a scanty living by teaching, and who
at last abandoned the school and the child
whose birth may, perhaps, have sent her a
nameless wanderer in a strange country,—for
“the Jerseys” were far away from Rye
parish in those days.</p>

<p>There was a schoolmistress in Hempstead
at a later date. She was old in 1774. I
don’t know her name, but I know of the end
of her days. The vestry allowed her forty
shillings, “to be dealt out to her a little at
a time, <i>so as to last her all winter</i>.” She
lived through that luxurious winter, and died
in 1775. Her coffin cost twelve shillings,
and Widow Thurston was paid six shillings
for digging the grave for her old crony and
gossip. Schoolmistresses were not many on
Long Island,—can we wonder at it? Had
this dame been one of the penniless church-poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
in a Dutch community (which Hempstead
was not), she would probably have had
forty shillings a month instead of a winter,
and a funeral that would have been not only
decent in all the necessities of a funeral, but
a triumph of prodigality in all the comforts
and pleasures of the mortuary accompaniments
of the day, such as wine, rum, beer,
cakes, tobacco, and pipes.</p>

<p>The “book-learning” afforded to colonial
girls in New York was certainly very
meagre. Mrs. Anne Grant wrote of the
first quarter of the eighteenth century:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was at that time very difficult to procure
the means of instruction in those island districts;
female education was, of consequence, conducted
on a very limited scale; girls learned needlework
(in which they were indeed both skilful and ingenious)
from their mothers and aunts; they were
taught, too, at that period to read, in Dutch, the
Bible, and a few Calvinistic tracts of the devotional
kind. But in the infancy of the settlement few
girls read English; when they did, they were
thought accomplished; they generally spoke it,
however imperfectly, and few were taught writing.”</p>
</div>

<p>William Smith, the historian of New
York, writing during the year 1756 of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
fellow townswomen, and of education in
general in New York, gives what was doubtless
a true picture of the inelegance of education
in New York:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is nothing they [New York women] so
generally neglect as Reading, and indeed all the
Arts for the improvement of the Mind, in which I
confess we have set them the Example. Our
Schools are in the Lowest Order, the Instructors
want Instruction, and through a long, shameful neglect
of the Arts and Sciences our Common Speech
is very corrupt, and the Evidences of a Bad Taste
both as to thought and Language are visible in all
our Proceedings publick and private.”</p>
</div>

<p>One obstacle to the establishment and
success of schools and education was the
hybridization of language. New Yorkers
spoke neither perfect Dutch nor good English.
It was difficult in some townships to
gather an English-speaking jury; hence,
naturally, neither tongue could be taught
save in the early and simpler stages of education.
It was difficult for those little Dutch-men
who heard Holland-Dutch spoken constantly
at home to abandon it entirely and
speak English in the schools. The Flatbush
master (himself a Dutchman, but bound to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
teach English) invented an ingenious plan
to crowd out the use of Dutch in school.
He carried a little metal token which he gave
each day to the first scholar whom he heard
use a Dutch word. That scholar could
promptly turn the token over to any other
scholar whom he likewise detected in using
Dutch, and he in turn could do the same.
Thus the token passed from hand to hand
through the day; but the unlucky wight who
chanced to have possession of it when the
school day was over was soundly whipped.</p>

<p>In default of “spilling,” as one master
wrote in his receipts, and in which he was
somewhat shaky himself, he and all other
colonial teachers took a firm stand on
“cyphering.” “The Bible and figgers is all
I want my boys to know,” said one old
farmer. When the school session opened
and closed, as we have seen in Flatbush,
with prayer and praise, with catechism every
day, and special catechising twice a week,
even “figgers” did not have much of a
chance. All the old Dutch primers that
I have seen, the <i>Groot A B C boeks zeer
bekwaam voor de yongekinderen te leeren</i>,
contain nothing (besides the alphabet) but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
religious sentences, prayers, verses of the
Bible, pious rhymes, etc.; and dingy little
books they are, not even up to the standard
of our well-known New England Primer.</p>

<p>Though the Dutch were great printers of
horn-books, I do not find that they were
universal users of those quaint little “engines
of learning.” If used in Dutch-American
schools, none now survive the lapse of two
centuries; and indeed only one can be found
in a Holland museum. Mr. Tuer, the historian
of the horn-book, states that there is
one in the museum at Antwerp, printed by
H. Walpot, of Dordrecht, Netherlands, in
1640; and a beautiful silver-backed Dutch
horn-book in the collection of an English
clergyman at Coombe Place, England; and a
few others in public libraries that are probably
Dutch. Dutch artists show, by their
frequent representations of horn-books in
paintings of children, that the little <i>a-b-boordje</i>
was well known. In the “Christ
blessing Little Children,” by Rembrandt,
the presentment of a child has a horn-book
hanging at his side. In several pictures
by Jan Steen, 1626-79, horn-books may be
noted; in one a child has hung his horn-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
on a parrot’s perch while he plays. In 1753
English children used horn-books in New
York as in the other provinces, for they were
advertised with Bibles and primers in the
New York newspapers at that time.</p>

<p>Printed arithmetics were rarely used or
seen. Schoolmasters carried with them carefully
executed “sum-books” in manuscript,
from which scholars copied the sums and
rules into small blank-books of their own.
One, of a Gravesend scholar in 1754, has
evidently served to prove the pupil’s skill
both in arithmetic and penmanship. The
book is prefaced by instructive aphorisms,
such as “Carefully mind to mend in every
line;” “Game not in school when you should
write.” The wording of the rules is somewhat
curious. One reads:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Rule of Bartar, which is for exchanging of ware,
One Commodity for another. This Rule shows
the Merchants how they may Proportion their
Goods so that neither of them may sustain loss.
Sum. Two Merchants A. and B. bartar. A. hath
320 Dozen of Candles @ ⁴⁄₆ per Dozen; for
which B. giveth him £30 in Cash and y<sup>e</sup> Rest in
Cotton @ 8d per lb. I demand: how much Cotton
B. must give A. more than the £30 in Cash.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>As commerce increased and many young
men sought a seafaring life, navigation was
taught, and advanced mathematics. In 1749
the notice of a Brooklyn “Philomath” on
Nassau Island shows that he could teach
“Arithmetick vulgar and decimal; Geometry
plain and Spherical; Surveying, Navigation
in 3 kinds, viz: Plain Mercator and Great
Circle Sailing, Astronomy, and Dialling.”
Thus did this Philomath meet the demand of
the day. In 1773 the Flatbush Grammar
School was taught by John Copp, who also
took scholar-boarders, who “have the advantage
of being taught geography in the winter
evenings, with many other useful particulars
that frequently occur to the teacher,” which
seems to present a rather melancholy picture
when we reflect on the other particulars of
good coasting and skating that then were
around Flatbush, on the <i>Steenbakkery</i> for
instance, which, doubtless, would frequently
occur on winter evenings to the scholar-boarder.</p>

</div>


<p>The domestic life of the Dutch settlers
flowed on in a smooth-running and rather dull
stream, varying little through either honor-bearing
or discreditable incident from day to
day. Any turbulence of dissension or divorce
between husband and wife was apparently
little known and certainly little noted. Occasionally
an entry which tells of temporary
division or infelicity can be unearthed from
the dingy pages of some old court-record,
thereby disclosing a scene and actors so
remote, so shadowy, so dimmed with the dust
of centuries, that the incident often bears no
semblance of having happened to real living
folk, but seems rather to pertain to a group
of inanimate puppets. One of these featureless,
colorless, stiff Dutch marionettes is
Anneke, the daughter of boisterous old Domine
Schaets, the first minister at Fort Orange.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
A fleeting glimpse of her marital infelicity is
disclosed through the record of her presence
in Albany under the shadow of some
unexplained and now forgotten scandal. To
satisfy her father’s virtuous and severe congregation,
she refrained from contaminating
attendance at Communion. The domine
resented this condition of affairs, and refused
to appear before the Consistory though summoned
four times by the <i>bode</i>. He persisted
in irritatingly “ripping up new differences
and offences;” and he disregarded with
equal scorn the summons of a magistrate to
appear before the Court; and he was therefore
suspended from his clerical office. All
was at last “arranged in love and friendship,”
leaving out the dispute about “Universal
Grace,” which I suppose could not be settled;
but daughter Anneke was ordered off to New
York to her husband, “with a letter of recommendation;
and as she was so headstrong,
and would not depart without the Sheriff’s
and Constable’s interference, her disobedience
was annexed to the letter.” It is pleasing
to know, from the record of an “Extraordinary
Court holden in Albany” a month
later,—in July, 1681,—of a very satisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
result in the affairs of the young
couple.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Tho: Davidtse promisses to conduct himself
well and honorably towards his wife Anneke Schaets,
to Love and never neglect her, but faithfully and
properly to maintain and support her with her children
according to his means, hereby making null
and void all questions that have occurred and
transpired between them both, never to repeat
them, but are entirely reconciled: and for better
assurance of his real Intention and good Resolution
to observe the same, he requests that two good
men be named to oversee his conduct at New
York towards his said wife, being entirely disposed
and inclined to live honorably and well with her as
a Christian man ought, subjecting himself willingly
to the rule and censure of the said men. On the
other hand his wife Anneke Schaets, promisses also
to conduct herself quietly and well and to accompany
him to New York with her children and property,
not to leave him any more, but to serve and
help him and with him to share the sweets and the
sours as becomes a Christian spouse: Requesting
all differences which had ever existed between them
both may be hereby quashed and brought no more
to light or cast up, as she on her side is heartily
disposed to. Their Worship of the Court Recommend
parties on both Sides to observe strictly their
Reconciliation now made, and the gentleman at
New York will be informed that the matter is so
far arranged.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>We can certainly add the profound hope,
after all this quarrelling and making up, after
all those good promises, that Anneke’s home
was no longer “unregulated and poorly kept,”
as was told of her by the Labadist travellers
during their visit to Albany at that time.
The appointing of “two good men” as arbitrators
or overseers of conduct was very usual
in such cases; thereby public adjustment in
open court of such quarrels was avoided.</p>

<p>Tender parents could not unduly shelter a
daughter who had left her husband’s bed and
board. He could promptly apply to the
court for an order for her return to him,
and an injunction to her parents against harboring
her. It has been plain to see in all
such cases which I have chanced upon in
colonial records that the Court had a strong
leaning towards the husband’s side of the
case; perhaps thinking, like Anneke Schaets,
that the wife should “share the sweets and
the sours like a Christian spouse.”</p>

<p>In 1697 Daniel Vanolinda petitioned that
his wife be “ordyred to go and live with him
where he thinks convenient.” The wife’s
father was promptly notified by the Albany
magistrates that he was “discharged to shelter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
her in his house or elsewhere, upon Penalty
as he will answer at his Perill;” and
she returned to her husband.</p>

<p>In the year 1665 a New Amsterdammer
named Lantsman and his wife, Beletje, were
sorely estranged, and went to the courts for
settlement of these differences. The Court
gave the matter into the hands of two of the
Dutch ministers, who were often assigned the
place of peacemakers. As usual, they ordered
the parents of Beletje to cease from harboring
or abetting her. The husband promised to
treat her well, but she answered that he always
broke his promises to her. He was determined
and assiduous to retrieve her, and
finally was successful; thus they were not
made “an example to other evil housekeepers.”
A curious feature of this marriage
quarrel is the fact that this Lantsman, who
was so determined to retain his wife, had
been more than recreant about marrying her.
The banns had been published, the wedding-day
set, but Bridegroom Lantsman did not
appear. Upon being hauled up and reprimanded,
his only proffered excuse was the
very simple one that his clothes were not
ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>When Anniatje Fabritius requested an
order of court for her husband to vacate her
house with a view of final separation from
him, it was decided by the arbitrators that no
legal steps should be taken, but that “the
parties comport themselves as they ought,
in order that they win back each other’s
affections, leaving each other in meanwhile
unmolested”—which was very sensible advice.
Another married pair having “met with
great discouragement” (which is certainly a
most polite expression to employ on such a subject),
agreed each to go his and her way, after
an exact halving of all their possessions.</p>

<p>Nicasius de Sille, magistrate of New
Utrecht and poet of New Netherland, separated
his life from that of his wife because—so
he said—she spent too much money. It
is very hard for me to think of a Dutch
woman as “expensefull,” to use Pepys’ word.
He also said she was too fond of schnapps,—which
her respected later life did not confirm.
Perhaps he spoke with poetic extravagance,
or the nervous irritability and exaggeration
of genius. Albert Andriese and his wife were
divorced in Albany in 1670, “because
strife and difference hath arisen between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
them.” Daniel Denton was divorced from his
wife in Jamaica, and she was permitted to
marry again, by the new provincial law of
divorce of 1672. These few examples break
the felicitous calm of colonial matrimony,
and have a few companions during the years
1670-72; but Chancellor Kent says “for
more than one hundred years preceding the
Revolution no divorce took place in the
colony of New York;” and there was no way
of dissolving a marriage save by special act
of Legislature.</p>

<p>Occasionally breach-of-promise suits were
brought. In 1654 Greetje Waemans produced
a marriage ring and two letters, promissory
of marriage, and requested that on that
evidence Daniel de Silla be “condemned to
legally marry her.” He vainly pleaded his
unfortunate habit of some days drinking too
much, and that on those days he did much
which he regretted; among other things, his
bacchanalian love-making of Greetje. François
Soleil, the New Amsterdam gunsmith,
another recreant lover, swore he would rather
go away and live with the Indians (a terrible
threat) than marry the fair Rose whom he
had left to droop neglected—and unmarried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>One curious law-case is shown by the
injunction to Pieter Kock and Anna van
Voorst. They had entered into an agreement
of marriage, and then had been unwilling
to be wedded. The burgomasters
and <i>schepens</i> decided that the promise should
remain in force, and that neither should
marry any other person without the permission
of the other and the Court; but Anna
did marry very calmly (when she got ready)
another more desirable and desired man
without asking any one’s permission.</p>

<p>It certainly gives us a great sense of the
simplicity of living in those days to read the
account of the suit of the patroon of Staten
Island in 1642 against the parents of a fair
young Elsje for loss of services through her
marriage. She had been bound out to him as
a servant, and had married secretly before her
time of service had expired. The bride told
the worshipful magistrates that she did not
know the young man when her mother and
another fetched him to see her; that she
refused his suit several times, but finally
married him willingly enough,—in fact, eloped
with him in a sail-boat. She demurely offered
to return to the Court, as compensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and mollification, the pocket-handkerchief
which was her husband’s wedding-gift to her.
Two years later, Elsje (already a widow)
appeared as plaintiff in a breach-of-promise
suit; and offered, as proof of her troth-plight,
a shilling-piece which was her second
lover’s not more magnificent gift. Though
not so stated in the chronicle, this handkerchief
was doubtless given in a “marriage-knot,”—a
handkerchief in which was tied
a gift of money. If the girl to whom it was
given untied the knot, it was a sign of consent
to be speedily married. This fashion
of marriage-knots still exists in parts of
Holland. Sometimes the knot bears a motto;
one reads when translated, “Being in love
does no harm if love finds its recompense in
love; but if love has ceased, all labor is in
vain. Praise God.”</p>

<p>Though second and third marriages were
common enough among the early settlers of
New Netherland, I find that usually attempts
at restraint of the wife were made through
wills ordering sequent loss of property if she
married again. Nearly all the wills are more
favorable to the children than to the wife.
Old Cornelius Van Catts, of Bushwick, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
died in 1726, devised his estate to his wife
Annetje with this gruff condition: “If she
happen to marry again, then I geff her nothing
of my estate, real or personal. But my wife
can be master of all by bringing up to good
learning my two children. But if she comes
to marry again, then her husband can take
her away from the farm.” John Burroughs,
of Newtown, Long Island, in his will dated 1678
expressed the general feeling of husbands
towards their prospective widows when he
said, “If my wife marry again, then her
husband must provide for her as I have.”</p>

<p>Often joint-wills were made by husband
and wife, each with equal rights if survivor.
This was peculiarly a Dutch fashion. In
Fordham in 1670 and 1673, Claude de
Maistre and his wife Hester du Bois, Pierre
Cresson and his wife Rachel Cloos, Gabriel
Carboosie and Brieta Wolferts, all made
joint-wills. The last-named husband in his
half of the will enjoined loss of property if
Brieta married again. Perhaps he thought
there had been enough marrying and giving
in marriage already in that family, for Brieta
had had three husbands,—a Dane, a Frieslander,
and a German,—and his first wife had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
had four, and he—well, several, I guess; and
there were a number of children; and you
couldn’t expect any poor Dutchman to find
it easy to make a will in all that confusion.
In Albany may be found several joint-wills,
among them two dated 1663 and 1676;
others in the Schuyler family. There is
something very touching in the thought of
those simple-minded husbands and wives, in
mutual confidence and affection, going, as we
find, before the notary together and signing
their will together, “out of love and special
nuptial affection, not thereto misled or sinisterly
persuaded,” she bequeathing her dower
or her father’s legacy or perhaps her own
little earnings, and he his hard-won guilders.
It was an act significant and emblematic of
the ideal unison of interests and purposes
which existed as a rule in the married life of
these New York colonists.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant adds abundant testimony to the
domestic happiness and the marital affection
of residents of Albany a century later. She
states:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Inconstancy or even indifference among married
couples was unheard of, even where there
happened to be a considerable disparity in point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
intellect. The extreme affection they bore their
mutual offspring was a bond that forever endeared
them to each other. Marriage in this colony was
always early, very often happy, and very seldom indeed
interested. When a man had no son, there
was nothing to be expected with a daughter but a
well brought-up female slave, and the furniture of
the best bed-chamber. At the death of her father
she obtained another division of his effects, such as
he thought she needed or deserved, for there was
no rule in these cases.</p>

<p>“Such was the manner in which those colonists
began life; nor must it be thought that those
were mean or uninformed persons. Patriots, magistrates,
generals, those who were afterwards wealthy,
powerful, and distinguished, all, except a few elder
brothers, occupied by their possessions at home,
set out in the same manner; and in after life, even
in the most prosperous circumstances, they delighted
to recount the ‘humble toils and destiny
obscure’ of their early years.”</p>
</div>

<p>Weddings usually took place at the house
of the bride’s parents. There are some
records of marriages in church in Albany in
the seventeenth century, one being celebrated
on Sunday. But certainly throughout the
eighteenth century few marriages were within
the church doors. Mrs. Vanderbilt says no
Flatbush marriages took place in the church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
till within the past thirty or forty years. In
some towns written permission of the parents
of the groom, as well as the bride, was
required by the domine before he would
perform the marriage ceremony. In the
Guelderland the express consent of father
and mother must be obtained before the
marriage; and doubtless that custom of the
Fatherland caused its adoption here in some
localities. The minister also in some cases
gave a certificate of permission for marriage;
here is one given by “ye minister at
Flatbush,”—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Isaac Hasselburg and Elizabeth Baylis have had
their proclamation in our church as commonly our
manner and custom is, and no opposition or hindrance
came against them, so as that they may be
confirmed in y<sup>e</sup> banns of Matrimony, whereto we
wish them blessing. Midwout y<sup>e</sup> March 17th,
1689.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Rudolph Varrick</span>, <i>Minister</i>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This was probably to permit and authorize
the marriage in another parish.</p>

<p>Marriage fees were not very high in colonial
days, nor were they apparently always retained
by the minister; for in one of Domine
Selyns’s accounts of the year 1662, we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
him paying over to the Consistory the sum
of seventy-eight guilders and ten stuyvers for
fourteen marriage fees received by him. The
expenses of being married were soon increased
by the issuing of marriage licenses.
During the century dating from the domination
of the British to the Revolutionary
War nearly all the marriages of genteel folk
were performed by special permission, by
Governor’s license, the payment for which
(a half-guinea each, so Kalm said) proved
through the large numbers a very welcome
addition to the magistrates’ incomes. It was
in fact deemed most plebeian, almost vulgar,
to be married by publication of the banns
for three Sundays in church, or posting
them according to the law, as was the universal
and fashionable custom in New England.
This notice from a New York newspaper,
dated December 13, 1765, will show
how widespread had been the aversion to the
publication of banns:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are creditly informed that there was married
last Sunday evening, by the Rev. Mr. Auchmuty, a
very respectable couple that had published three
different times in Trinity Church. A laudable example
and worthy to be followed. If this decent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and for many reasons proper method of publication
was once generally to take place, we should have no
more of clandestine marriages; and save the expense
of licenses, no inconsiderable sum these hard
and depressing times.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another reason for “crying the banns”
was given in Holt’s “New York Gazette and
Postboy” for December 6, 1765.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As no Licenses for Marriage could be obtained
since the first of November for Want of Stamped
Paper, we can assure the Publick several Genteel
Couple were publish’d in the different Churches of
this City last Week; and we hear that the young
Ladies of this Place are determined to Join Hands
with none but such as will to the utmost endeavour
to abolish the Custom of marrying with License
which Amounts to many Hundred per annum
which might be saved.”</p>
</div>

<p>Severe penalties were imposed upon clergymen
who violated the law requiring license
or publication ere marriage. The Lutheran
minister performed such a marriage, and the
<i>schout’s</i> “conclusion” as to the matter was
that the offending minister be flogged and
banished. But as he was old, and of former
good services, he was at last only suspended
a year from power of preaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Miller, an English clergyman writing
in 1695, complains that many marriages
were by justices of the peace. This was
made lawful by the States-General of Holland
from the year 1590, and thus was a law in New
Netherland. By the Duke’s Laws, 1664, it
was also made legal. This has never been
altered, and is to-day the law of the State.</p>

<p>Of highly colored romance in the life of the
Dutch colonists there was little. Sometimes
a lover was seized by the Indians, and his
fair betrothed mourned him through a long
life. In one case she died after a few years
of grief and waiting, and on the very day of
his return from his savage prison to his old
Long Island home he met the sad little
funeral procession bearing her to the grave.
Another humbler romance of Gravesend was
when a sorrowing widower fell in love with a
modest milkmaid at first sight as she milked
her father’s cows; ere the milking was finished
he told his love, rode to town on a fast horse
for a governor’s license, and married and
carried off his fair Grietje. A century later
a fair Quakeress of Flushing won in like
manner, when milking, the attention and
affection of Walter Franklin of New York.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Another and more strange meeting of lovers
was when young Livingstone, the first of the
name in New York, poor and unknown, came
to the bedside of a dying Van Rensselaer in
Albany to draw up a will. The dying man,
with a jealousy stronger than death, said to
his beautiful wife, Alida Schuyler, “Send
him away, he will be your second husband;”
and he was,—perhaps the thought provoked
the deed.</p>

<p>Even if there were few startling or picturesque
romances or brilliant matches, there
was plenty of ever-pleasant wooing. New
Amsterdam was celebrated, just before its
cession to the English, for its young and
marriageable folk and its betrothals. This is
easily explained; nearly all the first emigrants
were young married people, and the
years assigned to one generation had passed,
and their children had grown up and come to
mating-time. Shrewd travellers, who knew
where to get good capable wives, wooed and
won their brides among the Dutch-American
fair ones. Mr. Valentine says: “Several of the
daughters of wealthy burghers were mated to
young Englishmen whose first occasions were
of a temporary character.” The beautiful surroundings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
of the little town tempted all to
love-making, and the unchaperoned simplicity
of society aided early “matching.” The
Locust-Trees, a charming grove on a bluff
elevation on the North River a little south of
the present Trinity Churchyard, was a famous
courting-place; or tender lovers could stroll
down the “Maiden’s Path;” or, for still longer
walks, to the beautiful and baleful “Kolck,”
or “Collect,” or “Fresh Water,” as it was
sequentially called; and I cannot imagine
any young and susceptible hearts ever passing
without some access of sentiment through
any green field so sweetly named as the
“Clover Waytie.”</p>

<p>There were some curious marriage customs,—some
Dutch, some English. One
very pretty piece of folk-lore, of bride-honoring,
was brought to my notice through the
records of a lawsuit in the infant town of New
Harlem in 1663, as well as an amusing local
pendant to the celebration of the custom. It
seems that a certain young Harlem couple
were honored in the pleasant fashion of the
Fatherland, by having a “May-tree” set up
in front of their dwelling-place. But certain
gay young sparks of the neighborhood, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
anger the groom and cast ridicule on his
marriage, came with unseemly noise of blowing
of horns, and hung the lovely May-tree
during the night with ragged stockings. We
never shall know precisely what special taunt
or insult was offered or signified by this over-ripe
crop of worn-out hosiery; but it evidently
answered its tantalizing purpose, for
on the morrow, at break of day, the bridegroom
properly resented the “mockery and
insult,” cut down the hateful tree, and committed
other acts of great wrath; which,
being returned in kind (for thrice was the
stocking-full tree set up), developed a small
riot, and thus the whole affair was recorded.
Among the State Papers at Albany are
several letters relating to another insulting
“stocking-tree” set up in Albany at about
the same date, and also fiercely resented.</p>

<p>Collections for the church poor were
sometimes taken at weddings, as was the
universal custom for centuries in Holland.
When Stephanus Van Cortlandt and Gertrude
Schuyler were married in Albany, in
1671, thirteen guilders six stuyvers were contributed
at the wedding, and fifteen guilders
at the reception the following day. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
wedding of Martin Kreiger, the same year,
eleven guilders were collected; at another
wedding the same amount. When the daughter
of Domine Bogardus was married, it was
deemed a very favorable time and opportunity
to take up a subscription for building
the first stone church in New Amsterdam.
When the wedding-guests were all mellow
with wedding-cheer, “after the fourth or fifth
round of drinking,” says the chronicle, and,
hence generous, each vied with the other in
good-humored and pious liberality, they subscribed
“richly.” A few days later, so the
chronicle records, some wished to reconsider
the expensive and expansive transaction at
the wedding-feast, and “well repented it.”
But Director Kieft stiffly held them to their
contracts, and “nothing availed to excuse.”</p>

<p>It is said that the English drink of posset
was served at weddings. From the “New
York Gazette” of February 13, 1744, I copy
this receipt for its manufacture:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Receipt for all young Ladies that are going to

  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many frankly simple customs prevailed. I
do not know at how early a date the fashion
obtained of “coming out bride” on Sunday;
that is, the public appearance of bride and
groom, and sometimes entire bridal party in
wedding-array, at church the Sunday after
the marriage. It certainly was a common
custom long before Revolutionary times, in
New England as well as New York; but it
always seems to me more an English than a
Dutch fashion. Mr. Gabriel Furman, in his
manuscript Commonplace Book, dated 1810,
now owned by the Long Island Historical
Society, tells of one groom whom he remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
who appeared on the first Sunday after
his marriage attired in white broadcloth; on
the second, in brilliant blue and gold; on the
third, in peach-bloom with pearl buttons. The
bride’s dress, wholly shadowed by all this magnificence,
is not even named. Mrs. Vanderbilt
tells of a Flatbush bride of the last century,
who was married in a fawn-colored silk over
a light-blue damask petticoat. The wedding-waistcoat
of the groom was made of the
same light-blue damask,—a delicate and
deferential compliment. Often it was the
custom for the bridal pair to enter the
church after the service began, thus giving an
opportunity for the congregation to enjoy
thoroughly the wedding-finery. Whether
bride and groom were permitted to sit together
within the church, I do not know. Of
course ordinarily the seats of husband and
wife were separate. It would seem but a
poor show, with the bride in a corner with a
lot of old ladies, and the groom up in the
gallery.</p>

<p>On Long Island the gayety at the home of
the bride’s parents was often followed on the
succeeding day by “open house” at the
house of the groom’s parents, when the wedding-party,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
bridesmaids and all, helped to
keep up the life of the wedding-day. An
old letter says of weddings in the city of
New York:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Gentlemen’s Parents keep Open house
just in the same manner as the Bride’s Parents.
The Gentlemen go from the Bridegroom’s house to
drink Punch with and give Joy to his Father. The
Bride’s visitors go in the same manner from the
Bride’s to her mother’s to pay their compliments to
her. There is so much driving about at these
times that in our narrow streets there is some danger.
The Wedding-house resembles a bee-hive.
Company perpetually flying in and out.”</p>
</div>

<p>All this was in vogue by the middle of the
last century. There was no leaving home by
bride and groom just when every one wanted
them,—no tiresome, tedious wedding-journey;
all cheerfully enjoyed the presence of the
bride, and partook of the gayety the wedding
brought. In the country, up the Hudson
and on Long Island, it was lengthened out by
a bride-visiting,—an entertaining of the bridal
party from day to day by various hospitable
friends and relations for many miles around;
and this bride-visiting was usually made on
horseback.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Let us picture a bride-visiting in spring-time
on Long Island, where, as Hendrick
Hudson said, “the land was pleasant with
grass and flowers and goodly trees as ever
seen, and very sweet smells came therefrom.”
The fair bride, with her happy husband; the
gayly dressed bridesmaids, in silken petticoats,
and high-heeled scarlet shoes, with rolled
and powdered hair dressed with feathers and
gauze, riding a-pillion behind the groom’s
young friends, in satin knee-breeches, and gay
coats and cocked hats,—all the accompanying
young folk in the picturesque and gallant dress
of the times, and gay with laughter and happy
voices,—a sight pretty to see in the village
streets, or, fairer still, in the country
lanes, where the woods were purely starred and
gleaming with the radiant dogwood; or roads
where fence-lines were “white with blossoming
cherry-trees as if touched with lightest
snow;” or where pink apple-blossoms flushed
the fields and dooryards; or, sweeter far,
where the flickering shadows fell through a
bridal arch of the pale green feathery foliage
of the abundant flowering locust-trees, whose
beautiful hanging racemes of exquisite pink-flushed
blossoms cast abroad a sensuous perfume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
like orange blossoms, which fitted the
warmth, the glowing sunlight, the fair bride,
the beginning of a new life;—let us picture
in our minds this June bride-visiting; we have
not its like to-day in quaintness, simplicity,
and beauty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br><span class="small">TOWN LIFE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The earlier towns in New Netherland
gathered usually closely around a fort, both
for protection and companionship. In New
Amsterdam, as in Albany, this fort was an
intended refuge against possible Indian
attacks, and also in New Amsterdam the
established quarters in the new world of the
Dutch West India Company. As the settlement
increased, roads were laid out in the
little settlement leading from the fort to any
other desired point on the lower part of the
island. Thus Heere Straat, the Breede
Weg, or Broadway, led from the fort of New
Amsterdam to the common pasture-lands.
Hoogh Straat, now Stone Street, was evolved
from part of the road which led down to the
much-used Ferry to Long Island, at what is
now Peck Slip. Whitehall Street was the
shortest way to the East River. In front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the fort was the Bowling Green. Other
streets were laid out, or rather grew, as
needs increased. They were irregular in
width and wandering in direction. They
were not paved nor kept in good order, and
at night were scarcely lighted.</p>

<p>In December, 1697, city lamps were ordered
in New York “in the dark time of the
moon, for the ease of the inhabitants.” Every
seventh house was to cause a lanthorn and
candle to be hung out on a pole, the expense
to be equally shared by the seven neighbors,
and a penalty of ninepence was decreed
for every default. And perhaps the
watch called out in New York, as did the
watch in Old York, in London and other
English cities, “Lanthorne, and a whole
candell-light! Hang out your lights here.”
An old chap-book has a watchman’s rhyme
beginning,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A light here! maids, hang out your light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And see your horns be clear and bright</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That so your candle clear may shine,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Broad Street was in early days a canal or
inlet of the sea, and was called De Heere
Graft, and extended from the East River to
Wall Street. Its waters, as far as Exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Place, rose and fell with the tide. It was
crossed by several foot-bridges and a broader
bridge at Hoogh Straat, or Stone Street,
which bridge became a general meeting-place,
a centre of trade. And when the burghers
and merchants decided to meet regularly
at this bridge every Friday morning,
they thus and then and there established the
first Exchange in New York City. It is
pleasant to note, in spite of the many miles
of city growth, how closely the exchange
centres have remained near their first home.
In 1660 the walks on the banks of the Graft
were paved, and soon it was bordered by the
dwellings of good citizens; much favored on
account of the homelikeness, so Mr. Janvier
suggests, of having a good, strong-smelling
canal constantly under one’s nose, and ever-present
the pleasant familiar sight of squat
sailor-men and squat craft before one’s eyes.
In 1676, when simple and primitive ways of
trade were vanishing and the watercourse
was no longer useful or needful, the Heere
Graft was filled in—reluctantly, we can believe—and
became Broad Street.</p>

<p>The first mention of street-cleaning was in
1695, when Mr. Vanderspiegle undertook the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
job for thirty pounds a year. By 1701 considerable
pains was taken to clean the city,
and to remove obstructions in the public
ways. Every Friday dirt was swept by each
citizen in a heap in front of his or her house,
and afterwards carted away by public cartmen,
who had threepence a load if the citizen
shovelled the dirt into the cart, sixpence if
the cartman loaded his cart himself. Broad
Street was cleaned by a public scavenger at
a salary of $40 per annum paid by the city;
for the dirt from other streets was constantly
washed into it by rains, and it was felt that
Broad Street residents should not be held
responsible for other people’s dirt. Dumping-places
were established. Regard was paid
from an early date to preserving “the Commons.”
It was ordered that lime should not
be burnt thereon; that no hoopsticks or saplings
growing thereon should be cut; no timber
taken to make into charcoal; no turfs or
sods carried away therefrom; no holes dug
therein; no rubbish be deposited thereon.</p>

<p>Within the city walls all was orderly and
quiet. “All persons who enter y<sup>e</sup> gates of
y<sup>e</sup> citty with slees, carts and horses, horseback,
not to ride faster than foot-tap.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
carters were forced to dismount and walk at
their horses’ heads. All moved slowly in the
town streets. Living in a fortified town,
they still were not annoyed by discharge of
guns, for the idle “fyring of pistells and
gunns” was prohibited on account of “ill-conveniants.”</p>

<p>The first houses were framed and clap-boarded;
the roofs were thatched with reeds;
the chimneys were catted, made of logs of
wood filled and covered with clay; sometimes
even of reeds and mortar,—for there were,
of course, at first no bricks. Hayricks stood
in the public streets. Hence fires were frequent
in the town, breaking out in the wooden
catted chimneys; and the destruction of the
inflammable chimneys was decreed by the
magistrates. In 1648 it was ordered in
New Amsterdam that no “wooden or platted
chimney” should be built south of the Fresh-water
Pond. Fire-wardens—<i>brandt-meesters</i>—were
appointed, who searched constantly
and pryingly for “foul chimney-harts,” and
fined careless housekeepers therefor when
they found them.</p>

<p>It is really surprising as well as amusing
to see how the citizens resented this effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
for their safety, this espionage over their
hearthstones; and especially the wives
resented the snooping in their kitchens.
They abused the poor <i>schout</i> who inspected
the chimney-hearths, calling him “a little
cock, booted and spurred,” and other demeaning
names. In 1658 Maddaleen Dirck, as
she passed the door of the fire-warden, called
out tantalizingly to him, “There is the
chimney-sweep at his door,—his chimney is
always well-swept.” She must have been
well scared and truly repentant at the enormity
of her offence when she was brought up
before the magistrates and accused of having
“insulted the worshipful fire-warden on the
highway, and incited a riot.”</p>

<p>In spite of vigilance and in spite of laws,
foul chimneys were constantly found. We
hear of the town authorities “reciting that
they have long since condemned flag-roofs,
and wooden and platted chimneys, but their
orders have been neglected, and several fires
have occurred; therefore they amplify their
former orders as follows: All flag-roofs,
wooden chimneys, hay-barracks, and hay-stacks
shall be taken down within four months,
in the penalty of twenty-five guilders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The magistrates further equipped the town
against conflagration by demanding payment
of a beaver skin from each house, to purchase
with the collected sum two hundred and fifty
leather fire-buckets from the Fatherland.
But delays were frequent in ocean transportation,
and the shoemakers in town finally made
the fire-buckets. They were placed in ten
groups in various houses throughout the town.
For their good order and renewal, each chimney
was thereafter taxed a guilder a year.
By 1738, two engines with small, solid
wooden wheels or rollers were imported from
England, and cared for with much pride.</p>

<p>In Albany similar wooden chimneys at
first were built; we find contractors delivering
reeds for roofs and chimneys. “Fire-leathes”
and buckets were ordered. Buckets
were owned by individuals and the town;
were marked with initials for identification.
Many stood a century of use, and still exist
as cherished relics. The manner of bucket-service
was this: As soon as an alarm of fire
was given by shouts or bell-ringing, all citizens
of all classes at once ran to the scene of
the conflagration. All who owned buckets
carried them, and from open windows other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
fire-buckets were flung out on the streets by
persons who were delayed for a few moments
by any cause. The running crowd seized the
buckets, and on reaching the fire a double
line was made from the fire to the river.
The buckets filled with water were passed
up the line to the fire, the empty buckets
down. Any one who attempted to break the
line was promptly soused with a bucket of
water. When all was over, the fire-warden
took charge of the buckets, and as soon as
possible the owners appeared, and each
claimed and carried home his own buckets.</p>

<p>There was a police department in New
Amsterdam as well as a fire department. In
1658 the burgomasters and <i>schepens</i> appointed
a <i>ratel-wacht</i>, or rattle-watch, of ten
watchmen, of whom Lodewyck Pos was Captain.
Their wages were high,—twenty-four
stuyvers (about fifty cents) each a night, and
plenty of firewood. The Captain collected
fifty stuyvers a month from each house,—not
as has since been collected in like manner
for the private bribing of the police, but as a
legalized method of paying expenses. The
rules for the watch are amusing, but cannot
be given in full. They sometimes slept on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
duty, as they do now, and paid a fine of ten
stuyvers for each offence. They could not
swear, nor fight, nor be “unreasonable;” and
“when they receive their quarter-money, they
shall not hold any gathering for drink nor
any club meeting.”</p>

<p>Attention is called to one rule then in
force: “If a watchman receive any sum of
money as a fee, he shall give the same to the
Captain; and this fee so brought in shall be
paid to the City Treasurer”—oh the good
old times!</p>

<p>The presence of a considerable force of
troops was a feature of life in some towns.
The soldiers were well cared for when quartered
within the fort, sleeping on good, soft,
goose-feather beds, with warm homespun
blankets and even with linen sheets, all hired
from the Dutch <i>vrouws</i>; and supplied during
the winter with plentiful loads of firewood,
several hundred, through levy on the inhabitants;
good hard wood, too,—“no watte
Pyn wood, willige, oly noote, nor Lindewood”
(which was intended for English, but
needs translation into “white pine, willow,
butternut, nor linden”).</p>

<p>No doubt the soldiers came to be felt a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
great burden, for often they were billeted in
private houses. We find one citizen writing
seriously what reads amusingly like modern
slang,—that “they made him weary.” Another
would furnish bedding, provisions, anything,
if he need not have any soldier-boarders
assigned to him. One of the
twenty-three clauses of the “Articles of
Surrender” of the Dutch was that the
“townsmen of Manhattans shall not have any
soldiers quartered upon them without being
satisfied and paid for them by their officers.”
In Governor Nicholl’s written instructions
to the commander at Fort Albany, he urges
him not to lend “too easey an eare” to
the soldiers’ complaints against their land-lords.</p>

<p>Since in the year 1658 the soldiers of
New Amsterdam paid but twenty cents a
week for quarters when lodged with a citizen,
it is not surprising that their presence
was not desired. A soldier’s pay was four
dollars a month.</p>

<p>They were lawless fellows, too lazy to chop
wood for their fires; they had to be punished
for burning up for firewood the stockades
they were enlisted to protect. Their duties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
were slight,—a drill in the morning, no
sentry work during the day, a watch over the
city gates at night, and cutting wood. The
military code of the day reveals a very
lax condition of discipline; it wasn’t really
much of an army in Dutch days. And as
for the Fort and the Battery in the town of
New Amsterdam, read Mr. Janvier’s papers
thereon to learn fully their innocuous pretence
of warlikeness.</p>

<p>There was very irregular foreign and in-land
mail service. It is with a retrospectively
pitying shiver that we read a notice, as
late as 1730, that “whoever inclines to perform
the foot-post to Albany this winter may
make application to the Post-Master.” Later
we find the postmaster leisurely collecting
the mail during several weeks for “the first
post to Albany this winter.” Of course this
foot-post was only made when the river was
frozen over; swift sloops carried the summer
mail up the river in two or three weeks,—sometimes
in only ten days from New York
to Albany. I can fancy the lonesome post
journeying alone up the solemn river, under
the awe-full shadow of old Cro’nest, sometimes
climbing the icy Indian paths with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
<i>ys-sporen</i>, oftener, I hope, skating swiftly
along, as a good son of a Hollander should,
and longing every inch of the way for spring
and the “breaking-up” of the river.</p>

<p>In 1672, “Indian posts” carried the Albany
winter mail; trustworthy redmen, whose
endurance and honesty were at the service
of their white friends.</p>

<p>The first regular mail started by mounted
post from New York for Boston on January
1, 1673. His “portmantles” were crammed
with letters and “small portable goods” and
“divers bags.” He was “active, stout,
indefatigable, and honest.” He could not
change horses till he reached Hartford. He
was ordered to keep an eye out for the best
ways through forests, and accommodations at
fords, ferries, etc., and to watch for all
fugitive soldiers and servants, and to be
kind to all persons journeying in his company.
While he was gone eastward a locked
box stood in the office of the Colonial Secretary
at New York to collect the month’s
mail. The mail the post brought in return,
being prepaid, was carried to the “coffee-house,”
put on a table, well thumbed over by
all who cared to examine it, and gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
distributed, two or three weeks’ delay not
making much difference any way.</p>

<p>As in all plantations in a new land, there
was for a time in New Netherland a lack of
servants. Complaints were sent in 1649 to
the States-General of “the fewness of boors
and farm-servants.” Domestic servants were
not found in many households; the capable
wife and daughters performed the housework
and dairy work. As soon as servants were
desired they were speedily procured from
Africa. The Dutch brought the first negro
slaves to America. In the beginning these
slaves in New Netherland were the property
of the Dutch West India Company, which
rented their services. The company owned
slaves from the year 1625, when it first
established its authority, and promised to
each patroon twelve black men and women
from ships taken as prizes. In 1644 it
manumitted twelve of the negroes who had
worked faithfully nearly a score of years in
servitude. In 1652 the Government in
Holland consented to the exportation of
slaves to the colony for sale. In 1664 Governor
Stuyvesant writes of an auction of
negroes that they brought good prices, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
were a great relief to the garrison in supplying
funds to purchase food. Thus did the
colony taste the ease of ill-gotten wealth.
Though the Duke of York and his governors
attempted to check the slave-trade, by the
end of the century the negroes had increased
much in numbers in the colony. In the Kip
family were twelve negro house-servants.
Rip van Dam had five; Colonel de Peyster
and the Widow Van Courtlandt had each
seven adult servants. Colonel Bayard, William
Beeckman, David Provoost, and Madam
Van Schaick each had three.</p>

<p>On Long Island slaves abounded. It is
the universal testimony that they were
kindly treated by the Dutch,—too kindly,
our English lady thought, who rented out her
slaves. Masters were under some bonds to
the public. They could not, under Dutch
rule, whip their slaves without authorization
from the government. The letters in
the Lloyd Collection in regard to the slave
Obium are striking examples of kindly consideration,
and of constant care and thought
for his comfort and happiness.</p>

<p>The wages of a hired servant-girl in New
York in 1655 were three dollars and a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
a month, which was very good pay when we
consider the purchasing power of money at
that time. It is not till the eighteenth century
that we read of the beginning of our vast
servant-supply of Irish servants.</p>

<p>There was much binding out of children
and young folk for terms of service. In
Stuyvesant’s time several invoices of Dutch
children from the almshouses were sent to
America to be put to service, and the official
letters concerning them show much kindliness
of thought and intent towards these
little waifs and strays. Early in the next
century a sad little band of Palatines was
bound out in New York families. It may
prove of interest to give one of the bonds
of indenture of a house-servant in Albany.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">This Indenture</span> witnesseth that Aulkey Hubertse,
Daughter of John Hubertse, of the Colony
of Rensselaerwyck deceased hath bound herself
as a Meniall Servant, and by these presents doth
voluntary and of her own free will and accord bind
herself as a Meniall Servant unto John Delemont
of the City of Albany, weaver, by and with the
consent of the Deacons of the Reformed Dutch
Church in the Citty of Albany, who are as overseers
in the disposal of the said Aulkey Hubertse
to serve from the date of these present Indentures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
unto the full end and term of time that the said
Aulkey Hubertse shall come to Age, all which time
fully to be Compleat and ended, during all which

that is to say, apparell fit for to have and to
wear as well on the Lords Day as working days,
both linning and woolen stockings and shoes and
other Necessarys meet for such a servant to have
and to wear, and for the true performance of all
and every of said Covenant and Agreements the
said parties bind themselves unto each other by
these presents.”</p>
</div>

<p>This indenture was signed and sealed in
the year 1710, and varied little from those of
previous years. Sometimes the apparel was
fully described, and was always good and
substantial—and Sunday attire was usually
furnished. Sarah Davis, bound out in
Albany in 1684, was to be taught to read and
knit stockings; was to have silk hoods and a
silk scarf for church wear, and substantial
petticoats and waistcoats, some of homespun,
some of “jersey-spun,” others of “carsoway,”
which was kersey.</p>

<p>“Redemptioners,” bound for a term of
service as domestic and farm servants, also
came from the various European States; and
good servants often did they prove, and good
citizens, too, when their terms of service
expired. There also opened in this emigration
of redemptioners a vast opportunity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
adventure. In the “New York Gazette” of
March 15, 1736, we read of one servant-girl
adventurer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We hear that about two years ago a certain
Irish gentlewoman was brought into this province
a servant, but she pretended to be a great fortune
worth some thousands (was called the Irish Beauty).
Her master confirming the same a certain young
man (Mr. S***ds), courted her; and she seemingly
shy, her master for a certain sum of money
makes up the match, and they were married and
go to their country-seat; but she not pleased with
that pursuades her husband to remove to the city
of New York and set up a great tavern. They did
so. Next she pursuades her husband to embark
for Ireland to get her great portion. When he
comes there he finds her mother a weeder of gardens
to get bread. In his absence Madam becomes
acquainted with one Davis, and they sell
and pack up her husband’s effects, which were
considerable, and embark for North Carolina.
When they come there they pass for man and
wife, and he first sells the negroes and other effects,
then sells her clothes and at last he sells her for a
servant, and with the produce returns to his wife
in Rhode Island, he having made a very good
voyage.”</p>
</div>

<p>They were constantly eloping with their
masters’ or mistresses’ wardrobes, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
with portions of both, and setting up
as gentlefolk on their own account. We
find one Jersey girl running a fine rig:
dressed in a velvet coat and scarlet knee-breeches,
with a sword, cocked hat, periwig,
and silken hose, she had a gay carouse in
New York tap-houses and tea-gardens, as
long as her stolen twenty pounds lasted; but
with an empty stomach, she ceased to play
the lad, and went sadly to the stone ketch.
I turn regretfully from the redemptioners;
they were the most picturesque and romance-bearing
element of the community.</p>

<p>But little is known of the early practice of
medicine in New Netherland, less than of the
other American colonies, and that little is
not of much importance. It must be remembered
that the times were what Lowell has
felicitously termed the twilight through
which alchemy was passing into chemistry,
and the science of medicine partook of mysticism.
Astrology and alchemy were not yet
things of the past. From the beginning of
the settlement the West India Company
paid a surgeon (Jacob Varravanger was the
name of one) to live in New Amsterdam and
care for the health of the Company’s “servants.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
But soon so many “freemen” came—that
is, not in the pay of the Company—that
some doubts arose in the minds of the
Council whether it would not be better to
save the salary, by trusting to independent
practitioners. There were three such in
New Amsterdam in 1652. They made pills
and a terrible dose of rhubarb, senna, and
port-wine, called “Vienna Drink.” But folk
were discouragingly healthy in the little town
in spite of poor water, and lack of drainage,
and filth in the streets, and the Graft. Van
der Donck said, “Galens have meagre soup
in that country;” and soon the poor doctors,
to add to their income, petitioned the Director
that none but surgeons should be allowed
to shave people. This was a weighty matter,
and after profound consideration, the Council
gave the following answer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That shaving doth not appertain exclusively to
<i>chirugery</i>, but is only an appanage thereof. That
no man can be prevented from operating herein
upon <i>himself</i>, or doing another this friendly act,
provided that it be through <i>courtesy</i>, and that he
do not receive any money for it, and do not keep
an open-shop of that sort, which is hereby forbidden,
declaring in regard to the last request, this
act to belong to <i>chirugery</i> and the health of man.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>And the surgeons on shore were protected
against the ship barbers, who landed and who
made some pretty grave mistakes when
attempting to doctor in the town. In 1658
Dr. Varravanger, somewhat disgusted at the
treatment of the sick, who, if they had no
families, had to trust to the care of strangers,
established the first New York Hospital,
which was, after all, only a clean and
suitable house with fire and wood and one
good woman to act as matron.</p>

<p>There was no lack of physicians,—half a
dozen by 1650. A century later, the historian
of the province pronounced the towns to
be swarming with quacks.</p>

<p>One tribute to old-time medicine and New
York medical men we owe still. The well-known
Kiersted Ointment manufactured and
sold in New York to-day is made from a
receipt of old Dr. Hans Kiersted’s, the best
colonial physician of his day, who came to
New York in 1638. The manufacture of this
ointment is a closely guarded family secret.
He married the daughter of the famous
Anneke Jans; and, in the centuries that
have passed, the descendants have had more
profit from the ointment than from the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
estate. There were plenty of “wise women”
to care for the increase of the populace; the
New Amsterdam midwife had a house built
for her by the government. It was a much
respected calling. The mother of Anneke
Jans was a midwife. They were licensed to
practise. Here is an appointment by the
Governor in 1670:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas I am given to understand that Tryntje
Meljers ye wife of Wynant Vander pool a sworn
and approved midwife at Albany in which Imployment
she hath Continued for y<sup>e</sup> span of fourteen
years past in good reputation not refusing her assistance
but on y<sup>e</sup> contrary affording her best help
to y<sup>e</sup> poorer sorte of people out of Christian Charity,
as well as to ye richer sorte for reward, and there
being severall other less skilfull women who upon
occasion will pretend to be midwives where they
can gain by it but refuse their helpe to y<sup>e</sup> poore.
These presents Certifye That I doe allow of y<sup>e</sup> said
Tryntje Meljers to be one of y<sup>e</sup> profest sworne
midwives at Albany, and that she and one more
skilfull woman be only admitted to Undertake
ye same there except upon Extraordinary occasions.
They continuing their Charitable assistance
to y<sup>e</sup> poore &amp; a diligent attendance on their
calling.”</p>
</div>

<p>The small number of settlers, the exigencies
and hardships of a planter’s life, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
absence of luxuries, as well as the simplicity
of social manners among the Dutch, prohibited
anything during the rule of the Dutch
in New Netherland which might, by a long
and liberal stretch of phraseology or idealization
of a revered ancestry, be termed fashionable
life.</p>

<p>They occasionally had a merry dinner.
Captain Beaulieu, a gay Frenchman who
brought a prize into port, gave a costly one
for fourteen persons; and as he did not pay
for it, it has passed into history. Governor
Stuyvesant had a fine dinner given to him
on the eve of one of his “gallant departures.”
De Vries has left us an amusing account
of a quarrelsome feast given by the gunner
of the Fort. Eating and drinking were ever
the Dutchman’s pleasures.</p>

<p>With the establishment of English rule
there came to the town of the Governor’s
residence, in the Province of New York as in
the other provinces, a little stilted attempt
at the semblance of a court.</p>

<p>Formal endeavors to have something of
the nature of a club were made under the
English governors, to promote a social feeling
in the town. A letter of the day says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
“Good correspondence is kept between the
English and Dutch; to keep it closer sixteen
families (ten Dutch and six English) have
had a constant meetting at each other’s houses
in Turnes twice every week in winter and
now in summer once. They meet at six at
night, and part at about eight or nine.” The
exceedingly early hours of these social functions
seem to accent the simplicity of the life
of the times even more than the absence of
any such meetings would have done. The
arrival of a new Governor was naturally an
important and fashionable event. When the
Earl and Countess of Bellomont landed in
New York in 1698 they were, of course,
greeted first with military salutes; four barrels
of gunpowder made sufficient noise of
welcome. Then a great dinner to a hundred
and fifty people was given. It was presided
over by the handsomest man in town. Mayor
de Peyster, and the fare consisted of “venison,
turkey, chicken, goose, pigeon, duck
and other game; mutton, beef, lamb, veal,
pork, sausages; with puddings, pastry, cakes
and choicest of wines.” It was a fine
welcome, but such dinners did not come
every day to the Governor; he had other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and sorrier gatherings in store. Soon we
hear of him shut up eight days in succession
in Albany (as he said in his exceedingly
plain English) “in a close chamber with
fifty sachems, who besides the stink of
bear’s grease with which they were plentifully
bedaubed, were continually smoking
and drinking of rum,” and coming back to
town in a “nasty slow little sloop.” No
wonder he fell dangerously sick with the
gout.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grant, writing of New York society
in the middle of the eighteenth century,
said:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At New York there was always a governor, a
few troops, and a kind of little court kept; there
was a mixed, and in some degree polished society.
To this the accession of many families of French
Huguenots rather above the middling rank, contributed
not a little.”</p>
</div>

<p>This little important circle had some fine
balls. On January 22, 1734, one was given
at the Fort on the birthday of the Prince of
Wales, which lasted till four in the morning.
Another was given in honor of the King’s
birthday. “The ladies made a splendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
appearance. Sometimes as many as a hundred
persons were present and took part.”</p>

<p>Occasionally a little flash of gossiping
brightness shows us a picture of the every-day
life of the times in the capital town.
Such a bit of eighteenth-century scandal is
the amusing account, from Mrs. Janet Montgomery’s
unpublished Memoirs, of Lady
Cornbury, wife of the Governor, Lord Cornbury.
She died in New York in 1706, much
eulogized, and most ostentatiously mourned
for by her husband. Mrs. Montgomery’s
account of her is this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The lady of this very just nobleman was equally
a character. He had fallen in love with her ear,
which was very beautiful. The ear ceased to please
and he treated her with neglect. Her pin-money
was withheld and she had no resource but begging
and stealing. She borrowed gowns and coats and
never returned them. As hers was the only carriage
in the city, the rolling of the wheels was easily
distinguished, and then the cry in the house was
‘There comes my lady; hide this, hide that, take
that away.’ Whatever she admired in her visit she
was sure to send for next day. She had a fancy to
have with her eight or ten young ladies, and make
them do her sewing work, for who could refuse
their daughters to my lady.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>What a picture of the times! the fashionable
though impecunious Englishwoman
and the score of industrious young Dutch-American
seamstresses sitting daily and
most unwillingly in the Governor’s parlor.</p>

<p>One of the most grotesque episodes in New
York political history, or indeed in the life
of any public official, was the extraordinary
notion of this same Governor, Lord Cornbury,
to dress in women’s clothes. Lord
Stanhope and Agnes Strickland both assert
that when Cornbury was appointed Governor
and told he was to represent her Majesty
Queen Anne, he fancied he must dress as a
woman. Other authorities attribute his
absurd masquerade to his fond belief that
in that garb he resembled the Queen, who
was his cousin. Mrs. Montgomery said it
was in consequence of a vow, and that in a
hoop and head-dress and with fan in hand
he was frequently seen in the evening on the
ramparts. A portrait of him owned by Lord
Hampton shows him in the woman’s dress of
the period, fan in hand. Truly it was, as
Lewis Morris wrote of him to the Secretary
of State, “a peculiar and detestable magot,”
and one which must have been most odious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
and trying to honest, manly New Yorkers,
and especially demoralizing to the soldiers
before whom he paraded in petticoats. When
summarily deposed by his cousin from his
governorship, he was promptly thrust into a
New York debtor’s prison, where he languished
till the death of his father made him
third Earl of Clarendon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br><span class="small">DUTCH TOWN HOMES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The first log houses of the settlers, with
their “reeden roofs,” were soon supplanted
by a more substantial form of edifice, Dutch,
naturally, in outline. They were set with
the gable-end to the street and were often
built of Dutch brick, or, at any rate, the
gable-ends were of brick.</p>

<p>Madam Knights’ description of the city of
New York and the houses is wonderfully
clear, as is every account from her graphic
pen, but very short:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Buildings are Brick Generaly, very stately
and high though not altogether like ours in Boston.
The Bricks in some of the Houses are of divers
Coullers and laid in Checkers, being glazed, look
very agreable. The inside of them is neat to
admiration; the wooden work, for only the walls
are plaster’d, and the Sumers and Gist are planed
and kept very white scour’d as so is all the partitions
if made of Bords.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Albany long preserved its Dutch appearance
and Dutch houses. Peter Kalm’s description
of the city of Albany is a good one, and would
well answer for other New York towns:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The houses in this town are very neat, and
partly built with stones covered with shingles of the
White Pine. Some are slated with tiles from Holland,
because the clay of this neighborhood is not
reckoned fit for tiles. Most of the houses are
built in the old way, with the gable-end towards
the street; the gable-end of brick and all the other
walls of planks. The gutters on the roofs reach
almost to the middle of the street. This preserves
the walls from being damaged by the rain, but it
is extremely disagreeable in rainy weather for the
people in the streets, there being hardly any means
of avoiding the water from the gutters.</p>

<p>“The street doors are generally in the middle of
the houses and on both sides are seats, on which,
during fair weather the people spend almost the
whole day, especially on those which are in the
shadow of the houses. In the evening these seats
are covered with people of both sexes, but this is
rather troublesome, as those who pass by are obliged
to greet everybody unless they will shock the politeness
of the inhabitants of this town. The streets
are broad and some of them are paved; in some
parts they are lined with trees. The long streets
are almost parallel to the river, and the others
intersect them at right angles.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Chandler, chaplain of one of
the Massachusetts regiments, stopped several
days in Albany in the year 1755. He
tells of the streets with rows of small button-trees,
of the brick houses curiously flowered
with black brick and dated with the same,
the Governor’s house having “two black
brick-hearts.” The houses one story high
with their gable-ends “notched like steps”
(he might have said with corbel-steps), were
surmounted with vanes, the figures of horses,
lions, geese, and sloops. There were window
shutters with loop-holes outside the cellars.
Smith, the historian of New York, writing at
the same time, calls the houses of all the
towns, “built of brick in Dutch taste.”
Daniel Denton, writing as early as 1670,
tells of the “red and black tile (of New
York) giving at a distance a pleasing aspect
to the Spectators.” All the old sketches of
the town which exist, crude as they are, certainly
do present a pleasing aspect.</p>

<p>The chief peculiarity of these houses were
the high roofs; some were extraordinarily
steep and thus afforded a garret, a loft, and
a cock-loft. There was reason and economy
in this form of roof. The shingle covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
was less costly than the walls, and the contraction
in size of second-story rooms was
not great.</p>

<p>Very few of the steep roofs in the earliest
days had eave-troughs, hence the occasional
use in early deeds and conveyances of the
descriptive term “free-drip.” At a later
date troughs were made of sections of the
bark of some tree (said to be birch) which
the Indians brought into town and sold to
house builders. Then came metal spouts
projecting several feet, as noted by Kalm.
In 1789, when Morse’s Geography was issued,
he speaks of the still projecting water-spouts
or gutters of Albany, “rendering it almost
dangerous to walk the streets on a rainy day;”
but in New York more modified fashions
obtained long before that time.</p>

<p>The windows were small; some had two
panes. When we learn that the ordinary
panes of glass imported at that time were
in size only six inches by eight inches, we
can see that the windows were only loop-holes.</p>

<p>The front doors were usually divided as in
Holland, into an upper and lower half.
They were in early days hung on strap-hinges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
afterwards on heavy iron hinges. In
the upper half of the door, or in a sort of
transom over the door, were set two round
bull’s-eyes of heavy greenish glass, just as
are seen in Holland. Often the door held
a knocker of brass or of iron. The door
usually opened with a latch.</p>

<p>The inventories of the household effects of
many of the early citizens of New York
might be given, to show the furnishings of
these homes. I choose the belongings of
Captain Kidd to show that “as he sailed, as
he sailed” he left a very comfortable home
behind him. He was, when he set up housekeeping
with his wife Sarah in 1692, not at
all a bad fellow, and certainly lived well.
He possessed these handsome and abundant
house furnishings:—</p>


<ul class="index">
<li class="ifrst">One dozen Turkey work chairs.</li>
<li class="ifrst">One dozen double-nailed leather chairs.</li>

<p>The early New Englanders sat in their
homes on stools and forms, and very rarely
on chairs. It is not so easy to know of
Dutch furnishings, for the words <i>stoel</i> and <i>setel</i>
and <i>banck</i>, which are found in early inventories,
all mean a chair, but also may not have
meant in colonial days what we now designate
as a chair. A <i>stoel</i> was really a seat of
any kind; and <i>stoels</i> there were in plenty
among the first settlers. As Cowper says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“Necessity invented stools,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Convenience next suggested elbow-chairs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Luxury the accomplished Sofa last.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this natural succession came the seats
of the colonists. The leather chairs with
double rows of nails—in Captain Kidd’s
list—were a very substantial and handsome
piece of furniture.</p>

<p>Tables there were in all houses, and looking-glasses
in all well-to-do homes. The
stands of Captain Kidd were small tables.
The carpets named after the tables were
doubtless table-covers. The early use of the
word was always a cover for a table.</p>

<p>A truly elegant piece of furniture—one in
use by well-to-do folk in all the colonies—was
a cupboard. Originally simply a table
for the display of cups and other vessels, it
came to have shelves and approach in form
our sideboard. An inventory of a New York
citizen of the year 1690 names a “Holland
cupboard furnished with earthenware and
purslin” worth fifteen pounds. Another
owned a French nut-wood cupboard of about
the same value. Cupboard-cloths usually
accompanied them. A few of these cupboards
still exist, usually their exact history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
forgotten, but still known as “Holland cupboards.”
As long as the inventories of
estates of deceased persons were made out
and registered with much minuteness of detail,
a single piece of furniture could be
traced readily from heir to heir, but unfortunately
only the older inventories display
this minuteness.</p>

<p>One unusual word may be noted, which is
found in New York inventories, <i>boilsted</i>,
<i>bilsted</i>, or <i>billsted</i>—as “a boilsted bed,” “a
boilsted bureau.” The “Century Dictionary”
gives <i>bilsted</i> as the native name of the
American sweet-gum tree, the liquidambar,
but Mr. Watson says <i>boilsted</i> or <i>bilsted</i> meant
maple,—hence these articles meant a bureau
of maplewood, etc.</p>

<p>A very common form of bedstead in early
days, both in town and farm houses, was the
one built into the house, scarcely more than
a bench to hold the bedding, usually set into
an alcove or recess. In a contract for the
“Ferry House,” built in Brooklyn in 1665
(the house in which the ferry-master lived),
we read one clause thus: “to wainscot the
east side the whole length of the house, and
in the recess two bedsteads (betste) one in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the front room and one in the inside room,
with a pantry at the end of the bedstead.”</p>

<p>This alcove <i>betste</i> was much like a cupboard;
it had doors which closed over it
when unoccupied and shut it from view.
This does not seem very tidy from our
modern point of view, but the heavily
curtained and upholstered beds of other
countries gave but little more opportunity of
airing. Adam Roelandsen, the first New
York schoolmaster, had these <i>betste</i> built in
his house; and Jan Peeck, the founder of
Peekskill, had four <i>betste</i> in his country
home, as certainly were needed by a man
who had—so he said—“a house full of children
and more besides.”</p>

<p>The <i>sloep-banck</i>, or <i>slaw-bunk</i>, was another
form, a folding-bed. This was also set
within closet doors or hanging curtains. It
was an oblong frame filled in with a network
of rope or strips of wood, set apart like the
slats of a bed. This frame was fastened to
the wall at one end, the bed’s head, with
heavy hinges; and at night it was placed in
a horizontal position, and the unhinged end,
or foot of the bed, was supported on heavy
turned legs which fitted into sockets in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
frame. When not in use, the frame was
hooked up against the wall and covered with
the curtains or doors.</p>

<p>Other <i>sloep-bancks</i> were stationary. One
sold in Albany in 1667 to William Brouwer
was worth ten guilders. Parson Chandler as
late as 1755 said the beds in Albany were
simply wooden boxes, each with feather-bed,
undersheet, and blanket cover. The kermis
bed, on which the Labadist fathers slept in
Brooklyn, was a pallet bed. Another bedstead
often named was the <i>trecke-bedde</i>, or the
<i>sloep-banck ap rollen</i>, which, as its name
implies, was on rollers. It was a trundle-bed,
and in the daytime was rolled under a
high-post bedstead, if there were one in the
room, and concealed by the valance of calico
or chiney.</p>

<p>The beds were deep and soft, of prime
geese feathers. For many years the custom
obtained of sleeping on one feather-bed and
under another of somewhat lighter weight.
The pillow-cases, called “pillow-bears,” or
pillow-clothes, were often of checked linen.
The hangings of the bed when it was curtained
were also, in families of moderate
means, of checked and striped linen, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
wealthier houses of kidderminster, camlet,
and harrateen. With English modes of living
came English furniture; among other innovations
the great carved four-poster, which,
richly hung with valances and tester, was,
as Mrs. Grant said, “the state-bed, the
family Teraphim, secretly worshipped and
only exhibited on rare occasions.” The
bedsteads of Captain Kidd with valances and
curtains were doubtless four-posters.</p>

<p>A notable feature in the house-furnishing
of early colonial days was the abundance and
good quality of household linen. The infrequency
of regular washing seasons and times
(often domestic washing took place but once
in three or four months) made a large amount
of bed, table, and personal linen a matter of
necessity in all thrifty, tidy households.
One family, in 1704 (not a very wealthy
one), had linen to the amount of five hundred
dollars. Francis Rombout, one of the early
mayors of New York, had, at the time of his
death, in the year 1690, fifty-six diaper napkins,
forty-two coarse napkins and towels,
thirteen table-cloths of linen and diaper,
fifty-one “pillow-bears,” thirty sheets, four
bolster-covers, ten checked “pillow-bears,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
two calico cupboard-cloths, six table-cloths,
four check chimney-cloths, two of linen;
worth in all, twenty-one pounds eleven
shillings.</p>

<p>Mynheer Marius, who was worth about
fifteen thousand dollars,—a rich man,—had
eight muslin sheets, twenty-three linen
sheets, thirty-two pillow-cases, two linen
table-cloths, seven diaper table-cloths, sixty-one
diaper napkins, three “ozenbergs” napkins,
sixteen small linen cupboard-cloths.
Colonel William Smith of Long Island was
not so rich as the last-named Dutch merchant,
but he had six hundred dollars’ worth
of linen. John Bowne, the old Quaker of
Flushing, Long Island, recorded in his
diary, in 1691, an account of his household
linen. He had four table-cloths, a dozen
napkins, a dozen towels, six fine sheets, two
cotton sheets, four coarse linen sheets, two
fine tow sheets, two bolster cases, nine fine
pillow-biers, four coarse pillow-biers.</p>

<p>In 1776, the house furnishings of a house
in Westchester County in the “Neutral
Ground,” were removed on account of the
war. The linen consisted of fifty-one linen
sheets, eleven damask table-cloths, one linen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
table-cloth, twenty-one homespun cloths,
four breakfast cloths, twelve damask napkins,
fifty-six homespun napkins, fifteen
towels, twenty-nine pillow-cases.</p>

<p>This linen was usually kept in a great
linen chest often brought from Holland.
Made of panelled oak or of cedar, these
chests were not only useful, but ornamental.
They were substantial enough to have lasted
till our own day, unless wantonly destroyed
as clumsy and cumbersome, and a few have
survived.</p>

<p>There was one display of wealth which was
not wholly for the purpose of exhibiting the
luxury and refinement of the housekeeper,
but also served as a safe investment of surplus
funds,—household silver. From early
days silver tankards, spoons, dram-cups, and
porringers appear in inventories. Salt-cellars
and beakers are somewhat rare; but as
years crept on, candlesticks, salvers, coffee-pots,
teakettles, snuffers, bread-baskets, and
punch-bowls are on the list. When Captain
Kidd, the pirate, was a happy bridegroom in
1692, as a citizen of respectability and social
standing, he started housekeeping with three
hundred dollars’ worth of silver. Magistrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Marius had at the same time a silver
tankard, three salt-cellars, two beakers, a
mustard pot and spoon, twenty-seven sweet-meat
spoons, four tumblers, nine cups each
with two ears, a salver, a mug and cover, a
baby’s chafing-dish, a fork and cup. Governor
Rip van Dam had in silver three
tankards, a chafing-dish, three castors, two
candlesticks, snuffers and tray, two salvers,
a mug, salt-cellar and pepper-pot, and a
large number of spoons. Abraham de Peyster
had a splendid array: four tankards, two
decanters, two dishes, three plates, eleven
salvers, two cups and covers, two chafing-dishes,
six porringers, four sauce-boats, two
punch-bowls, three mugs, four sugar-dishes,
a coffee-pot and tea-pot, seven salts and
shovels, a saucepan, four pairs snuffers and
stand, a mustard-pot, a bread-basket, a
dram-bottle, tobacco-dish, nine castors, six
candlesticks, one waiter, twenty-three forks,
three soup-spoons, two punch ladles, ten
table-spoons, ten teaspoons, two sugar-tongs;
truly a display fit for a fine English
hall. We may note in this, as in many
other inventories, that the number of small
pieces seems very small and inadequate; ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
teaspoons and twenty-three forks appear
vastly disproportioned to the great pieces
of plate.</p>

<p>These outfits of silver were, of course,
unusual, but nearly all families had some
pieces; and even on farms there would be
seen fine pieces of silver.</p>

<p>Curious forms of Dutch silver were the
“bite and stir” sugar boxes, often shell-shaped,
with a partition in the middle. On
one side was placed the loaf sugar, which
could be nibbled with the tea; on the other,
the powdered or granulated sugar, which
could be stirred into the teacup with a tea-spoon.
Another graceful piece was the <i>ooma</i>,
or sifter, for the mixed cinnamon and sugar
with which many sprinkled their hot waffles.
An <i>ooma</i> resembled a muffineer. The name
was derived from the Dutch <i>oom</i>, an uncle,
and the article was a favorite gift of an uncle
on the wedding day of niece or nephew. We
find Dutch dames leaving by will “milk-pots
shaped like a cow,” a familiar form of Dutch
silver, and can readily believe that much
silver owned in New York was made in
Holland.</p>

<p>Coming from a country where the manufacture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of porcelain and stone-ware was already
of much importance, and the importation of
Oriental china was considerable, it is not
strange that we find more frequent mention
of articles of china than in the English colonies.
For instance, Mayor Francis Rombouts
came to this country as clerk for a
Dutch commercial house and died in 1690.
He had a cupboard furnished with earthenware
and “purslin:” twenty-six earthen
dishes, earthen pots, twelve earthen “cupps,”
six “purslin cupps,” six earthen “juggs,” six
pitchers, which was really a very pretty
showing. Doubtless the “purslin” was
Delft. In the list of early sales at Fort
Orange, earthen-ware appears. In New
England, in similar sales, its name would
never be seen.</p>

<p>Trim and orderly pieces of furniture, as
well as pretty ones, were the various hanging
wall-racks for plates, knives, and spoons.
I presume they were shaped like the ones
still in use in Holland. We find in inventories
<i>lepel-borties</i> (which were spoon-racks)
as early as 1664. When an oaken plate-rack
was filled with shining pewter plates,
Delft dishes, or even red earthen “Portugese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
ware,” it made a thoroughly artistic
decoration for the walls of the old
Dutch kitchen. There were also stands or
boxes with divisions for holding knives and
forks.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br><span class="small">DUTCH FARMHOUSES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The old Dutch homestead of colonial times
fitted the place and the race for which it was
built. There was plenty of solid level earth
for it to stand on,—so it spread out, sunny
and long. The men who built it had never
climbed hills or lived on mountain-tops, nor
did they mean to climb many stairs in their
houses. The ceilings were low, the stairs
short and steep, and the stories few; a story
and a half were enough for nearly every one.
The heavy roof, curving slightly inward, often
stretched out in front at the eaves to form a
shelter for the front stoop. Sometimes in the
rear it ran out and down over a lean-to to
within six or eight feet from the ground.
Sometimes dormer windows broke the long
roof-slope and gave light to the bedrooms or
garret within. This long roof contracted the
walls of the second-story bedrooms, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
afforded a generous, useful garret, which to
the Dutch housekeeper was one of the best
rooms in the house.</p>

<p>The long side of the house was usually set
to receive the southern sunshine; if convenient,
the gable-end was turned to the street or
lane; for, being built when there were poor
roads and comparatively little travel, and
when the settlers were few in number, each
house was not isolated in lonesome woods or
in the middle of each farm, but was set cosily
and neighborly just as close to those of the
other settlers as the extent of each farm
would allow, and thus formed a little village
street.</p>

<p>The windows of these houses were small
and had solid wooden shutters, heavily hinged
with black-painted iron hinges. Sometimes
a small crescent-shaped opening cut in the
upper portion of the shutter let in a little
dancing ray of light at early dawn into the
darkened room. In the village as in the city
the stoop was an important feature of the
house and of home life. Through the summer
months the family gathered on this out-door
sitting-room at the close of day.
The neighbors talked politics as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
smoked their evening pipes, and the young
folk did some mild visiting and courting.
As the evening and pipes waned, little negro
slaves brought comfortiers, or open metal
dishes of living coals, to start the smouldering
tobacco afresh in the long Dutch
pipes.</p>

<p>The cellar of these old farmhouses was a
carefully built apartment, for it played a most
important part in the orderly round, in the
machinery of household affairs. It was built
with thought, for it had to be cool in summer
and warm in winter. To accomplish the
latter result, its few small windows and
gratings were carefully closed and packed
with salt hay in the autumn, and a single
trap-door opening outside the house furnished
winter entrance. Within this darkened
cellar were vast food-stores which put
to shame our modern petty purchases of
weekly supplies. There were always found
great bins of apples, potatoes, turnips, and
parsnips. These vegetables always rotted a
little toward spring and sprouted, and though
carefully sorted out and picked over sent up
to the <i>kamer</i> above a semi-musty, damp-earthy,
rotten-appley, mouldy-potatoey smell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
which, all who have encountered will agree,
is unique and indescribable. Strongly bound
barrels of vinegar and cider and often of rum
lay in firm racks in this cellar; and sometimes
they leaked a little at the spigot, and
added their sharply alcoholic fumes to the
other cellar-smells. Great hogsheads of
corned beef, barrels of salt pork, hams
seething in brine ere being smoked, tonnekens
of salted shad and mackerel, firkins of
butter, kilderkins of home-made lard, jars
of pickles, kegs of pigs’ feet, or souse,
tumblers of spiced fruits, graced this noble
cellar. On a swing-shelf were <i>rolliches</i> and
head-cheese and festoons of sausages. On
such a solid foundation, over such a storage-room
of plenty, thrift, and prudence, stood
that sturdy edifice,—the home-comfort of the
New York farmer.</p>

<p>On the ground-floor above were low-studded
rooms, one called the <i>kamer</i>, which
was the parlor and spare bedroom as well;
for on its clean sanded floor often stood the
best bedstead, of handsome carved mahogany
posts, with splendid high-piled feather-beds,
heavy hangings, and homespun linen sheets
and pillow-cases. Back of this <i>kamer</i>, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
linter, was the milk-room. The spinning-room
with its spinning-wheels was the sitting-room,
or occasionally the kitchen, and the
bedroom adjoining was called the spinning-room
<i>kametje</i>. There were often four or five
spinning-wheels in a family, and their merry
hum meant lively work. The furniture of
these rooms was in character much like
that of townhouses, and all had sanded
floors. Above these rooms were comfortable
chambers; and above the chambers the
garret.</p>

<p>A more loving pen than mine has drawn
the old garrets of the Flatbush farmhouses,
with their cast-off furniture, old trunks, and
bandboxes; the unused cradle and crib;
the little end window with its spider-webs and
yellow wasps buzzing angrily, and beating
with extended wings against the dingy panes,
or sitting in dull clusters, motionless and
silent, along the moulding; the rough chimneys;
the spinning-wheels and looms, the
wooden pegs with discarded clothing. Mrs.
Vanderbilt says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The shingled roof which overarched the garret
in all its length and breadth was discolored by
time, and streaked and stained with the leakage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
caused by hard northeast storms; there were tin-pans
and sea-shells apparently placed at random
over the floor in a purposeless way, but which
were intended to catch the drip when the warped
shingles admitted the rain. In winter there were
little drifts of snow here and there which had
sifted through the nail-holes and cracks.”</p>
</div>

<p>The garret was a famous drying-place in
winter-time for the vast washings. Often long
adjustable poles were fitted from rafter to
rafter to hold the hanging garments.</p>

<p>In the garret, beside the chimney and
opening into it, was the smokehouse, sometimes
shaped like a cask. Too heavy and
big to have been brought in and up to the
garret, it was probably built in it. Around
this smokehouse were hung hams and
sausages, and sides of bacon and dried beef.
These usually were not cured in this garret
smokehouse; that was simply a storage-place,
in which they could be kept properly
dry and a little smoked.</p>

<p>Of the <i>kamer</i>, or parlor, of New Amsterdam
Irving wrote, with but slight exaggeration
of its sanctity and cherished condition:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The grand parlor was the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>,
where the passion for cleaning was indulged without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
control. In this sacred apartment no one
was permitted to enter excepting the mistress and
her confidential maid, who visited it once a week,
for the purpose of giving it a thorough cleaning—always
taking the precaution of leaving their shoes
at the door, and entering devoutly on their stocking-feet.
After scrubbing the floor, sprinkling it
with fine white sand, which was curiously stroked
into angles, and curves, and rhomboids, with a
broom—after washing the windows, rubbing and
polishing the furniture, and putting a new bunch
of evergreens in the fireplace—the window
shutters were again closed to keep out the flies, and
the room carefully locked up till the revolution of
time brought round the weekly cleaning-day.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Grant fully confirms and emphasizes
this account as applicable to the parlors of
country-houses as well.</p>

<p>The kitchen was usually in a long rambling
ell at one gable-end of the house, rarely in an
ell at right angles to the main house; in it
centred the picturesqueness of the farm-house.
It was a delightful apartment, bustling
with activity, cheerful of aspect. On one side
always stood a dresser.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">“Every room was bright</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With glimpses of reflected light</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From plates that on the dresser shone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p>The shining pewter plates, polished like
silver, were part of every thrifty housewife’s
store; a garnish of pewter, which was a set
of different-sized plates, was often her wedding-gift.
Their use lingered till this century, and
many pieces now are cherished heirlooms.</p>

<p>Methods of cooking and cooking utensils
varied much from those of the present day.
The great brick oven was built beside the
fireplace; sometimes it projected beyond the
exterior of the building. It had a smoke-uptake
in the upper part, from which a flue
connected with the fireplace chimney. It
was heated by being filled with burning dry-wood
called oven-wood. When the wood
was entirely consumed, the ashes were swept
out with an oven-broom called a <i>boender</i>.
A Dutch oven, or Dutch kitchen, was an
entirely different affair. This was made of
metal, usually tin, cylindrical in form, and
open on one side, which was placed next the
fire. Through this ran a spit by which meat
could be turned when roasting. A bake-kettle,
or bake-pan, was a metal pan which
stood up on stumpy legs and was fitted with
a tightly fitting, slightly convex cover on
which hot coals were placed. Within this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
bake-pan hot biscuit or a single loaf of
bread or cake could be baked to perfection.</p>

<p>Across the chimney was a back-bar, sometimes
of green wood, preferably of iron; on
it hung pot-hooks and trammels, which under
the various titles of pot-hangers, pot-claws,
pot-clips, pot-brakes, and crooks, appear in
every home-inventory. On those pot-hooks
of various lengths, pots and kettles could be
hung at varying heights above the fire.
Often a large plate of iron, called the fire-plate,
or fire-back, was set at the back-base of
the kitchen chimney, where raged so constant
and so fierce a fire that brick and mortar
crumbled before it. These fire-backs were
often cast in a handsome design, sometimes a
Scriptural subject. These chimneys were
vast in size; Kalm said you could drive a
horse and cart through them. Irving says
they were “of patriarchal magnitude, where
the whole family enjoyed a community of
privileges and had each a right to a corner.”
Often they were built without jambs.
Madam Knights wrote in 1704 of New York
townhouses:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fireplaces have no jambs (as ours have),
but the backs run flush with the walls, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
hearth is of tiles and is as far out into the room at
the ends as before the fire, which is generally five
foot in the lower rooms, and the piece over where
the mantle-tree should be is made as ours with
joiners’ work and as I suppose is fastened to iron
rods inside.”</p>
</div>

<p>The kitchen fireplace was high as well as
wide, and disclosed a vast smoky throat.
When the week’s cooking was ended and the
Sabbath was approaching, this great fireplace
was dressed up, put on its best clothes
for Sunday, as did all the rest of the family;
across the top was hung a short petticoat, or
valance, or little curtain gathered full on a
string. This was called a <i>schouwe-kleedt</i>, a
<i>schoorsteen valletje</i>, or sometimes a <i>dobbelstee-tiens
valletje</i>, this latter in allusion to the stuff
of which the valance was usually made,—a
strong close homespun linen checked off with
blue or red. This clean, sweet linen frill was
placed, freshly washed and ironed, every Saturday
afternoon on the faithful, work-worn
chimney while it took its Sunday rest. In
some houses there hung throughout the week
a <i>schoorsteen valletje</i>; in others it was only
Sunday gear. This was a fashion from early
colonial days for both town and country. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
the house of Mayor Rombouts in 1690 were
fine chimney-cloths trimmed with fringe and
lace, and worth half a pound each, and
humbler checked chimney-cloths. Cornelius
Steenwyck a few years earlier had in his
“great chamber” a still gayer <i>valletje</i> of
flowered tabby to match the tabby window-curtains.
Peter Marius had calico valances
for his chimneys.</p>

<p>A description given by a Scotchwoman of
fireplaces in Holland at about this date shows
very plainly from whence this form of hearth-dressing
and chimney were derived:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The chimney-places are very droll-like; they
have no jams nor lintell, as we have, but a flat
grate, and there projects over it a lum in a form of
the cat-and-clay lum, and commonly a muslin or
ruffled pawn around it.”</p>
</div>

<p>When tiles were used for facing the fireplace
and even for hearths, as they often
were in the <i>kamer</i>, or parlor, they were usually
of Delft manufacture, printed in dull blue
with coarsely executed outline drawings of
Scriptural scenes. In the Van Cortlandt
manor-house, the tiles were pure white. I
have some of the tiles taken from the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Schermerhorn house in Brooklyn, built in the
middle of the seventeenth century and demolished
in 1895. There were nearly two hundred
in each fireplace in the house. The
scenes were from the Old Testament, and
several, if I interpret their significance aright,
from the Apocrypha. The figures are discreetly
attired in Dutch costumes. Irving
says of these Scripture-tiles: “Tobit and his
dog figured to great advantage; Haman
swung conspicuously on his gibbet; Jonah
appeared most manfully bursting out of the
whale, like Harlequin through a barrel of
fire.” To these let me add the very amusing
one of Lazarus leaving his tomb, triumphantly
waving the flag of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Sometimes the space between the open
fireplace and the ceiling of the <i>kamer</i> was
panelled, and it had a narrow ledge of a mantelpiece
upon which usually were placed a
pair of silver, brass, or pewter candlesticks
and a snuffers with tray. Occasionally a
<i>blekker</i>, or hanging candlestick, hung over the
mantel. In some handsome houses the sur-base
was of tiles and also the staircase; but
such luxuries were unusual.</p>

<p>Domestic comfort and kindly charity sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
enthroned in every room of these Dutch
homes. Daniel Denton wrote of them as
early as 1670:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Though their low-roofed houses may seem to
shut their doors against pride and luxury, yet how
do they stand wide open to let charity in and out,
either to assist each other, or relieve a stranger.”</p>
</div>

<p>In these neighborly homes thrift and simple
plenty and sober satisfaction in life had
full sway; and these true and honorable
modes of living lingered long, even to our
own day. On the outskirts of a great city,
within a few miles of the centre of our greatest
city, still stand some of the farmhouses of
Flatbush, whose story has been told <i>con amore</i>
by one to the manner born. These old
homesteads form an object-lesson which we
may heed with profit to-day, of the dignity,
the happiness, the beauty that comes from
simplicity in every-day life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="small">THE DUTCH LARDER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There is no doubt that the Dutch colonists
were very valiant trenchermen; more
avid, perhaps, of quantity and frequency in
their food than exacting of variety. Cardinal
Bentivoglio (the diplomatist and historian)
writing at the time of the first emigration to
New Netherland, says that the greatest pleasures
of the Hollanders were those of the
table. This love of eating made them provident
and lavish of food-stores in emigration;
and the accounts of scant supplies, poor fare,
and dire starvation which are recorded of
other colonies, never have been told of the
<i>vol-gevoedt</i> Dutch. Then, too, they landed
on a generous shore,—no rock-bound coast,—Hendrick
Hudson said the finest soil for
cultivation that he ever set foot on. The
welcoming fields richly nourished and multiplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
the Hollanders’ store of seeds and roots
and grafts. The rye quickly grew so tall that
a man could bind the ears together above
his head. Van der Donck saw a field of
barley in New Netherland in which the barley
stems were seven feet high. Domine Megapolensis
stated that a Rensselaerwyck <i>schepen</i>
raised fine crops of wheat on the same field
eleven years in succession. Two ripe crops
of peas or of buckwheat could be raised on
the same land in one season. The soil seemed
inexhaustible; and fields and woods also
offered to the settlers a rich native larder.
Among these American food supplies came
first and ever the native Indian corn, or
“Turkie-wheat.” The Dutch (fond of all
cereal foods) took to their liking and their
kitchens with speed the various forms of
corn-food.</p>

<p>Samp and samp porridge were soon their
favorite dishes. Samp is Indian corn pounded
to a coarsely ground powder in a mortar.
Like nearly all the foods made of the various
forms of Indian corn, its name is of Indian
derivation, and usually its method of preparation
and cooking. Roger Williams wrote
of it:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nawsamp is a kind of meal pottage unparched.
From this the English call their samp; which is
the Indian corn beaten and boiled.”</p>
</div>

<p>Samp porridge was a derivative of Indian
and Dutch parentage. It was samp cooked
in Dutch fashion, like a <i>hutespot</i>, or hodgepot,
with salt beef or pork and potatoes and other
roots, such as carrots and turnips. These
were boiled together in a vast kettle, usually
in large quantity, as the porridge was better
liked after several days’ cooking. A week’s
supply for a family was often cooked at one
time. After much boiling a strong crust was
formed next the pot, and sometimes toward
the end of the boiling the porridge was
lifted out of the pot bodily—so to speak—by
the crust and served crust and all.
Samp was pounded in a primitive and picturesque
Indian mortar made of a hollowed
block of wood, or the stump of a tree. The
pestle was a heavy block of wood shaped
like the interior of the mortar and fitted with
a handle attached to one side. This block
was fastened to the top of a growing sapling
which gave it the required spring back after
being pounded down on the corn. Pounding
samp was slow work, often done in later years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
by unskilled negroes and hence disparagingly
termed “niggering” corn. After those simple
mortars were abandoned elsewhere they
were used on Long Island; and it was jestingly
told that skippers in a fog could always
get their bearings off the Long Island coast
because they could hear the pounding of the
samp-mortars.</p>

<p>Suppawn, another favorite of the settlers
in New York, was an Indian dish made from
Indian corn; it was a thick corn-meal and
milk porridge. It soon was seen on every
Dutch table, and is spoken of by all travellers
in early New York.</p>

<p>From the gossiping pages of the Labadist
preachers we find hints of good fare in Brooklyn
in 1679:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Then was thrown upon the fire, to be roasted, a
pail full of Gowanes oysters which are the best in
the country. They are fully as good as those of
England, better than those we eat at Falmouth. I
had to try some of them raw. They are large and
full, some of them not less than a foot long. Others
are young and small. In consequence of the great
quantities of them everybody keeps the shells for
the burning of lime. They pickle the oysters in
small casks and send them to Barbados. We had
for supper a roasted haunch of venison which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
had bought of the Indians for three guilders and a
half of sea-want, that is fifteen stivers of Dutch
money (fifteen cents), and which weighed thirty
pounds. The meat was exceedingly tender and
good and also quite fat. It had a slight aromatic
flavor. We were also served with wild turkey,
which was also fat and of a good flavor, and a wild
goose, but that was rather dry. We saw here
lying in a heap a whole hill of watermelons which
were as large as pumpkins.”</p>
</div>

<p>De Vries tells of an abundant supply of
game in the colony; deer (as fat as any
Holland deer can be); great wild turkeys,
beautiful birds of golden bronze (one that
he shot weighed thirty pounds); partridges
and pigeons (in such great flocks that the
sky was darkened). Domine Megapolensis
says the plentiful wild turkeys and deer
came to the hogpens of the Albany colonists
to feed; fat Dutch swine and graceful
red deer must have seemed strange trough
companions. A stag was sold readily by an
Indian for a jack-knife. In 1695 Rev. Mr.
Miller said a quarter of venison could be
bought “at your door” for ninepence. Wild
swan came in plenty, “so that the bays and
shores where they resort appear as if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
were dressed in white drapery.” Down the
river swam hundreds of gray and white-headed
geese nearly as stately as the swan;
Van der Donck knew a gunner (and gives his
name, Henry de Backer) who killed eleven
gray geese with one shot from his gun. Gray
ducks and pelicans were plentiful and cheap.
Gone forever from the waters of New York
are the beautiful gray ducks, white swan,
gray geese, and pelican; anent these can we
sigh for the good old times. The Earl of
Strafford’s letters and despatches, telling of
the “Commodities of the Island called
Maniti ore Long Ile wch is in the Continent
of Virgenea,” confirms all these
reports and even tells of “fayre Turkees
far greater than here, five hundred in a
flocke,”—which must have proved a noble
sight.</p>

<p>The river was full of fish, and the bay;
their plenty inspired the first poet of New
Netherland to rhyming enumeration; among
them were sturgeon—despised of Christians;
and terrapin—not despised. “Some persons,”
wrote Van der Donck in 1656, “prepare
delicious dishes from the water terrapin,
which is luscious food.” Two centuries and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
a half of appreciation pay equally warm tribute
to the terrapin’s reputation.</p>

<p>Patriarchal lobsters five and six feet long
were in the bay. Van der Donck says “those
a foot long are better for serving at table.”
Truly a lobster six feet long would seem a
little awkward to serve. W. Eddis, in his
“Letters from America” written in 1792,
says these vast lobsters were caught in New
York waters until Revolutionary days when
“since the late incessant cannonading, they
have entirely forsaken the coast; not one
having been taken or seen since the commencement
of hostilities.” Crabs, too, were
large, and some were “altogether soft.” Van
der Donck corroborates the foot-long oysters
seen by the Labadists. He says the “large
oysters roasted or stewed make a good bite,”—a
very good bite, it would seem.</p>

<p>Salted fish was as carefully prepared and
amiably regarded in New York as in England
and Holland at the same date. The ling
and herring of the old country gave place in
New York to shad. The greatest pains was
taken in preparing, drying, and salting the
plentiful shad. It is said that in towns, as in
New York and Brooklyn, great heaps of shad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
were left when purchased at each door, and
that the necessary cleaning and preparation
was done on the street. As all housewives
purchased shad and salted and packed at
about the same time, those public scavengers,
the domestic hogs, who roamed the town-streets
unchecked (and ever welcomed), must
have been specially useful at shad-time.</p>

<p>At a very early date apple-trees were set
out and cultivated with much care and much
success. Nowhere else, says Dankers, had
he seen such fine apples. He notes the
Double Paradise. The Newtown pippin, the
Kingston spitzenburgh, the Poughkeepsie
swaar-apple, the red-streak, guelderleng, and
others of well-known name, show New York’s
attention to apple-raising. Kalm, the Swedish
naturalist, spoke of the splendid apple-orchards
throughout New York in 1749, and
told of the horse-press for making cider.
Cider soon rivalled in domestic use the beer
of the Fatherland. It was constantly used
during the winter season, and, diluted with
water, sweetened, and flavored with nutmeg,
made a grateful summer drink.</p>

<p>Peaches were in such lavish abundance as
to become uncared for. The roads were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
covered with fallen peaches which even the
ever-filled hogs would not eat. Plums were
equally plentiful. Cherry-trees were planted
in good numbers and produced in great quantities.
“All travellers and passers-by could
pick and eat at will,” says Kalm. Comparatively
scanty and poor are peaches, plums,
and cherries in New York State to-day.</p>

<p>There were also plenty of vegetables:
<i>cibollen</i> (chibbals), <i>peasen</i> (pease), <i>chicoreye</i>
(chiccory), <i>karoten</i> (carrots), <i>artichock</i> (artichoke),
<i>lattouwe</i> (lettuce), <i>beeten</i> (beets),
<i>pastinaken</i> (parsnips), <i>radys</i> (radish), and
many others. Pumpkins and squashes
abounded, but do not appear to have been in
as universal use as in New England. <i>Quaasiens</i>
were so easily cooked “they were a
favorite with the young women,” says one
authority; they “grew rapidly and digested
well,” also were qualities accorded in their
favor. Under the name of <i>askutasquash</i>, or
vine-apples, Roger Williams sung their praises.
Musk-melons, water-melons, and cucumbers
were grown in large number and excellent
quality. Whether they cooked the <i>Duyvel’s
broodt</i>, the picturesque Dutch name for mushrooms,
I know not, but the teeming woods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
the Hudson valley offered them rich and
abundant store of this dainty food.</p>

<p>The Swedish naturalist, Kalm, visited Albany
in 1749. He has left to us a very full
account of Albany food and fashions of serving
at that time. He found the Albanians
faring as did their great grandfathers in the
Netherlands, who were sneeringly called
“milk and cheese men,” and he found them
rasping their cheese as had their far-away
forbears in Holland, and as do their descendants
in Holland to this day. He writes
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The inhabitants of Albany are much more
sparing than the English. The meat which is
served up is often insufficient to satisfy the stomach,
and the bowl does not circulate so freely as
among the English.... Their meat and manner
of dressing it is very different from that of
the English. Their Breakfast is tea, commonly
without milk. About thirty or forty years ago, tea
was unknown to them, and they breakfasted either
upon bread and butter or bread and milk. They
never put sugar into the cup but put a small bit of it
into their mouths while they drink. Along with the
tea they eat bread and butter with slices of hung
beef. Coffee is not usual here: they breakfast
generally about seven. Their dinner is buttermilk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
and bread to which they sometimes add sugar, and
then it is a delicious dish to them: or fresh milk
and bread: or boiled or roasted flesh. They
sometimes make use of buttermilk instead of fresh
milk to boil a thin kind of porridge with, which
tastes very sour but not disagreeable in hot weather.
To each dinner they have a great salad prepared
with abundance of vinegar and little or no oil.
They frequently eat buttermilk, bread and salad,
one mouthful after another. Their supper is generally
bread and butter, or milk and bread. They
sometimes eat cheese at breakfast and at dinner:
it is not in slices but scraped or rasped so as to
resemble coarse flour, which they pretend adds to
the good taste of cheese. They commonly drink
very small beer or pure water.”</p>
</div>

<p>The “great salad dressed with vinegar”
was doubtless “koolslaa,” shredded cabbage,
which we to-day call coleslaw. It was a universal
dish also at that time in Holland. A
woman-traveller there in 1756 wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Everything of vivers is dear in Holland except
vegetables, upon which the commons live all
summer, and the better sort a great deall. Every
body, great and small, sups on sallad with oil and
vinegar.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Dutch were famously fond of “bakers-meats,”—all
cakes and breads,—and excelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
in making them, and made them in
great variety. There was early legislation
with regard to bakers, that they use just
weights and good materials. In 1656 they
were ordered to bake twice a week “both
coarse and white loaves, both for Christians
and Indians,” at these prices: Fourteen stuyvers
for a double coarse loaf of eight pounds,
with smaller loaves at proportionate prices;
and eight stuyvers for a white loaf of two
pounds. Two years later the coarse wheat
loaf of eight pounds was definitely priced at
fourteen stuyvers in sea-want, ten in beavers,
and seven in silver. The bakers complained,
and a new assize of bread was established
at a slightly higher rate. Under Dongan’s
charter bread-viewers were appointed; then
the bread had to be marked with the baker’s
initials. I have puzzled over a prohibition of
any bakers selling <i>koeckjes</i>, jumbles, and sweet
cakes, unless he also had coarse bread for
sale; and fancy it was that the extravagant
and careless purchaser might not be tempted
or forced to buy too costly food. One baker
was prosecuted for having gingerbread in his
window when he had no coarse bread. There
were also “pye-women” as well as bakers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Favorite articles of food were three kinds
of fried cakes of close kinship, thus described
by Irving,—“the doughty doughnut, the
tender olykoek, the crisp and crumbling
cruller.” The doughnut was an equal favorite
in New England, and was in some localities
called a simball, or simblin; which was a
New England variant, a Puritan degradent of
the simbling-cake, or simnel, of the English
Mid-Lent Sunday. In New England country-houses
doughnuts were eaten, indeed, are
eaten, all the year around three meals a day;
but Mrs. Vanderbilt says the Dutch in Flatbush
only made them from November
through January, because at that period the
lard in which they were cooked was still
fresh. She also says they were limited in
their public appearance to the tea-table or for
children to eat “between-meals.” I don’t
know that I am willing to acquiesce in her
assumption that when the Pilgrims were in
Holland the English goodwives learned to
make doughnuts from the Dutch <i>vrouws</i>,
and thus be forced to yield doughnuts to
the other triumphs of “Dutch colonial
influence.”</p>

<p>The famous <i>olykoeks</i>, or <i>olijkoecks</i>, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
thus concocted, as given by an old Dutch
receipt of the year 1740 belonging to Mrs.
Morris Patterson Ferris:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“About twelve o’clock set a little yeast to rise,
so as to be ready at five <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> to mix with the
following ingredients: 3³⁄₄ pounds of flour, 1 pound
of sugar, ¹⁄₂ pound of butter and lard mixed, 1¹⁄₂
pints of milk, 6 eggs, 1 pint raised yeast. Warm
the butter, sugar and milk together, grate a nutmeg
in the flour, add eggs last. Place in a warm
place to rise. If quite light at bedtime, work
them down by pressing with the hand. At nine
next morning make into small balls with the
hand, and place in the centre of each a bit of
raisin, citron, and apple chopped fine. Lay on
a well-floured pie-board and allow them to rise
again. They are frequently ready to boil at two
o’clock. In removing them from the board use
a knife, well-floured, and just give them a little
roll with the hand to make them round. Have
the fat boiling, and boil each one five minutes.
When cool roll in sifted sugar.”</p>
</div>

<p>The name means literally oil-cakes, and
they were originally boiled or fried in oil.
They were called “melting,” and I am sure
from this description of the process of manufacture
they were delicate enough to deserve
the appellation. The Hessian officers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Revolutionary times give eloquent approval
of these “rich batter-cakes.”</p>

<p>Tea-cakes which were made both in New
England and New York were what Mrs. Vanderbilt
calls “izer-cookies.” They were so
termed from the Dutch word <i>izer</i>, or <i>yser</i>,
meaning iron; for they were baked in long-handled
irons called wafer-irons, which often
had the initials of the owners impressed in
the metal, which impression of course rendered
the letters in relief on the cakes.
Often a date was also stamped on the irons.
These wafer-irons sometimes formed part of a
wedding outfit, having the initials of the bride
and groom intertwined. The cakes were also
called split-cakes because, thin as they were,
often they were split and buttered before being
eaten. Other wafer-cakes were called
<i>oblyen</i>. Cinnamon-cakes resembled a delicate
jumble with powdered cinnamon sprinkled
on top. Puffards, or <i>puffertjes</i>, were
eaten hot with powdered cinnamon and sugar,
and were baked in a special pan, termed a
puffet-pan. Wonders were flavored with
orange peel and boiled in lard. Pork-cakes,
made of chopped pork with spices, almonds,
currants, raisins, and flavored with brandy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
were a rich cake. The famous Schuyler
wedding cake had among other ingredients,
twelve dozen eggs, forty-eight pounds of
raisins, twenty-four pounds of currants, four
quarts of brandy, a quart of rum. This was
mixed in a wash-tub.</p>

<p>Many of these cakes are now obsolete. In
one of the old inventories of the Van Cortlandt
family, in a list of kitchen utensils is
the item, “1 Bolly-byssha Pan.” This is the
Anglicized spelling of <i>bollo-bacia</i>,—<i>bolle</i> the
old Dutch and Spanish word for a bun, or
small loaf of flour and sugar; <i>bacia</i> the
Spanish for a metal pan. In old receipts in
the same family the word is called <i>bolla-bouche</i>
and <i>bolla-buysies</i>. The receipt runs
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To a pound of flower a quarter of a pound of
sugar, the same of butter, 4 egs, sum Nut-Meg
and Senamond, milk &amp; yeast, A pint of milk to
2 pound of flower.”</p>
</div>

<p>Domestic swine afforded the Dutch many
varied and appetizing foods. Two purely
Dutch dishes were <i>rolliches</i> and head cheese.
<i>Rolliches</i> were made of lean beef and fat cut
in pieces about as large as dice, then highly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
seasoned with herbs and spices, sewed in tripe
and boiled for several hours. This roll was
then pressed into an oblong loaf, which made
pretty slices when cut and served cold. Head
cheese, or <i>hoofd-kaas</i>, was similar in appearance,
but was made of pigs’-feet and portions
of the head chopped fine, boiled in a bag, and
pressed into the shape of a cheese. This also
was served in cold slices.</p>

<p><i>Speck ende kool</i>, pork and cabbage, was
another domestic stand-by; fried pork and
apples were made into an appetizing dinner
dish. Roast ducks were served with pork-dumplings,—of
which the mystery of manufacture
is unknown to me.</p>

<p>A great favorite of the Dutch is shown
through this advertisement in the “New York
Gazette” of December 17, 1750:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Printer hereof, ever mindful to please and
gratify his Customers, finding but little Entertainment
at present suitable to the Genius of many;
has been obliged to provide for the Winter Evening
Diversion of such of his Friends as are that way
inclined, A Parcel of the Nuts commonly called
KESKATOMAS NUTS which he sells at <i>One
Shilling</i> per Half a Peck. N. B. They are all
right ‘Sopus and of the right sort.’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>A writer in the “Literary World” in 1850
thus defines and eulogizes these nuts:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hickory, shell-bark, kiskitomas nut!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or whatsoever thou art called, thy praise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has ne’er been sounded yet in poet’s lays.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Michaux, in his “North American Sylva,”
says that many descendants of the Dutch in
New Jersey and New York still call the
hickory-nut <i>Kisky-Thomas-nuts</i>. The name is
derived from an Indian word, not from the
Dutch. These nuts were served at every
winter evening company, great or small.
Mrs. Grant tells of their appearance on the
tea-table.</p>

<p>Of the drinking habits of the Dutch colonists
I can say that they were those of all
the colonies,—excessive. Tempered in their
tastes somewhat by the universal brewing
and drinking of beer, they did not use as
much rum as the Puritans of New England,
nor drink as deeply as the Virginia planters;
but the use of liquor was universal. A libation
was poured on every transaction, every
action, at every happening in the community,
in public life as well as in private. John
Barleycorn was ever a witness at the drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
up of a contract, the signing of a deed, the
selling of a farm, the purchase of goods,
the arbitration of a suit. If either party to a
contract “backed out” before signing, he
did not back away from the “treat,” but had
to furnish half a barrel of beer or a gallon of
rum to assuage the pangs of disappointment.
Liquor was served at auctions or “vendues”
free, so Madam Knight says,—buyers becoming
expansive in bidding when well
primed. It appeared at weddings, funerals,
church-openings, deacon-ordainings, and
house-raisings. No farm hand in haying-field,
no sailor on a vessel, no workman in a
mill, no cobbler, tailor, carpenter, mason, or
tinker would work without some strong drink,
some treat. The bill for liquor where many
workmen were employed, as in a house-raising,
was often a heavy one.</p>

<p>A detailed example of the imperative furnishing
of liquor to workmen is found in the
contracts and bills for building in 1656 the
first stone house erected at Albany, a government
house or fort. It cost 12,213 guilders
in wampum, or about $3,500, and was built
under the charge of Jan de la Montague, the
Vice-Director of the Fort. Every step in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
erection of this building was taken knee-deep
in liquor. The dispensing of drink began
when the old wooden fort was levelled; a tun
of strong beer was furnished to the pullers-down.
At the laying of the first stones of
the wall a case of brandy, an anker (thirty-three
quarts) of brandy, and thirty-two guilders’
worth of other liquor wet the thirsty
whistles of the masons. When the cellar
beams were laid, the carpenters had their
turn. Two barrels of strong beer, three cases
of brandy, and seventy-two florins’ worth of
small beer rested them temporarily from their
labors. When the second tier of beams was
successfully in place, the carpenters had two
more cases of brandy and a barrel of beer.</p>

<p>The beams had already received a previous
“wetting;” for when brought to the building
they had been left without the wall, and had
been carried within, one at a time, by eight
men who had half a barrel of beer for each
beam. There were thirty-three beams in all.</p>

<p>All the wood-carriers, teamsters, carpenters,
stone-cutters, and masons had, besides these
special treats, a daily dram of a gill of brandy
apiece, and three pints of beer at dinner.
They were dissatisfied, and “solicited” another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
pint of beer. Even the carters who brought
wood and the boatmen who floated down
spars were served with liquor. When the
carpenters placed the roof-tree, a half-barrel
of liquor was given them. Another half-barrel
under the name of tiles-beer went to the
tile-setters. The special completion of the
winding staircase demanded five guilders’
worth of liquor. When the house was finished,
a <i>kraeg</i>, or housewarming, of both food
and drink to all the workmen and their wives
was demanded and refused. Well it might
be refused, when the liquor bill without it
amounted to seven hundred and sixteen
guilders.</p>

<p>The amount of liquor required to help in
conducting an election was very great. In
1738 James Alexander and Eventhus Van
Horne paid over seventy-two pounds for one
election bill. Liquor then was cheap. This
sum purchased sixty-two gallons of Jamaica
rum, several gallons of brandy, eight gallons
of lime-juice, a “pyd” of wine which cost sixteen
pounds (I don’t know what a “pyd”
could have been), a large amount of shrub, and
mugs and “gugs” and “bottels.” There were
also two bagpipes and a fiddler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>Let me give, as a feeble excuse for the
large consumption of beer, cider, etc., that
the water was poor in many of the towns.
Kalm wrote of the Albany water:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The water of several of the wells was very cool
about this time, but had a kind of acid taste which
was not very agreeable. I think this water is not
very wholesome for people who are not used to it.
Nearly every house in Albany has its well, the water
of which is applied to common use; but for tea,
brewing, and washing they commonly take the water
of the river.”</p>
</div>

<p>What can be the other “common use” to
which well-water was applied, except putting
out fires,—which is an infrequent use?</p>

<p>In New York City the water was equally
poor. The famous Tea-water Pump supplied
in barrels for many years the more fastidious
portion of the community. Perhaps we could
scarcely expect them to drink much water
when they had to buy it.</p>

<p>Our notions of life in New Netherland
have been so thoroughly shaped by Diedrich
Knickerbocker’s tergiversating account
thereof, that it would be difficult for us to
make any marked change in the picture he
has painted. Nor do we need to do so. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
though the details of public and official life
and characters in that day have been wilfully
distorted by Irving’s keen humor, still the
atmosphere of his picture is undeniably correct,
and the domestic life he has shown us
was the life of that colony. I find nothing,
after much illumination through careful examination
of old records and the contemporary
accounts given by early travellers, to change
in any considerable degree the estimate of
every-day life in New Netherland which I
gained from Irving, save in one respect,—the
account of Dutch table manners, and the attributing
to the Dutch burghers of lax hospitality
at dinner-time, which I cannot believe.
Madam Knight wrote of her New York hosts
in 1704:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They are sociable to one another, and Curteos
and Civill to Strangers, and fare well in their
houses.... They are sociable to a degree, their
tables being as free to their Naybours as themselves.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Grant, writing of Albanians half a century
later, gives a detailed description of their
manners as hosts, which might serve as an
explanation of apparent inhospitality in the
time of Walter the Doubter:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They were exceedingly social, and visited each
other very frequently, beside the regular assembling
together in porches every fine evening. Of the
more substantial luxuries of the table they knew
little, and of the formal and ceremonious parts of
good breeding still less.</p>

<p>“If you went to spend a day anywhere, you were
received in a manner we should think very cold. No
one rose to welcome you; no one wondered you
had not come sooner, or apologized for any deficiency
in your entertainment. Dinner, which was
very early, was served exactly in the same manner
as if there were only the family. The house, indeed,
was so exquisitely neat and well regulated,
that you could not surprise them; and they saw
each other so often and so easily that intimates
made no difference. Of strangers they were shy;
not by any means from want of hospitality, but
from a consciousness that people who had little
to value themselves on but their knowledge of the
modes and ceremonies of polished life disliked
their sincerity and despised their simplicity. If
you showed no insolent wonder, but easily and
quietly adopted their manners, you would receive
from them not only very great civility, but much
essential kindness.... After sharing this plain
and unceremonious dinner, which might, by the
bye, chance to be a very good one, but was invariably
that which was meant for the family, tea
was served in at a very early hour. And here it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
was that the distinction shown to strangers commenced.
Tea here was a perfect ‘regale,’ accompanied
by various sorts of cake unknown to us,
cold pastry, and great quantities of sweetmeats and
preserved fruits of various kinds, and plates of hickory
and other nuts ready cracked. In all manner
of confectionery and pastry these people excelled;
and having fruit in great abundance, which cost
them nothing, and getting sugar home at an easy
rate, in return for their exports to the West Indies,
the quantity of these articles used in families, otherwise
plain and frugal, was astonishing. Tea was
never unaccompanied with some of these petty
articles; but for strangers a great display was
made. If you stayed supper, you were sure of a
most substantial though plain one. In this meal
they departed, out of compliment to the strangers,
from their usual simplicity. Having dined between
twelve and one, you were quite prepared for it.
You had either game or poultry roasted, and always
shell-fish in the season; you had also fruit in
abundance. All this with much neatness, but no
form. The seeming coldness with which you were
first received wore off by degrees.”</p>
</div>

<p>It may be noted that Mrs. Grant gives a
very different notion of Albany fare than does
Kalm, already quoted; and she wrote scarce
a score of years after his account. She tells—in
this extract—not of wealthy folk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
though they were truly gentle-folk, if simplicity
of living, kindliness, and good sense
added in many cases to good birth could
make these plain Albanians gentle-folk. And
in truth it seems to me a cheerful picture,—one
of true though shy hospitality; pleasant
of contemplation in our days of formality and
extravagance of entertaining, of scant knowledge
of the true home life even of those we
call our friends.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br><span class="small">THE DUTCH VROUWS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There is much evidence to show that the
women of Dutch descent of the early years
of New Netherland and New York had other
traits than those of domestic housewifery;
they partook frequently of the shrewdness
and business sagacity and capacity of their
Dutch husbands. Widows felt no hesitation
and experienced no difficulty in carrying on
the business affairs of their dead partners;
wives having capable, active husbands boldly
engaged in independent business operations
of their own; their ventures were as extended
and fearless as those of the men. They
traded for peltries with the Indians with
marked success. I suspect part of the profit
may have come through the Indian braves’
serene confidence in their own superior
sagacity in bargaining and trafficking with
the “white squaws.” The Labadist travellers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
wrote thus despitefully of a “female-trader”
in Albany in 1679:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This woman, although not of openly godless
life, is more wise than devout, although her knowledge
is not very extensive, and does not surpass
that of the women of New Netherland. She is a
truly worldly woman, proud and conceited, and
sharp in trading with <i>wild</i> people as well as <i>tame</i>
ones, or what shall I call them not to give them the
name of Christians, or if I do, it is only to distinguish
them from the others. She has a husband,
who is her second one. He remains at home
quietly while she travels over the country to carry
on the trading. In fine, she is one of the Dutch
female-traders who understand the business so well.
If these be the persons who are to make Christians
of the heathen, what will the latter be?”</p>
</div>

<p>Certain traits of a still more influential
and widely known female-trader in New
Netherland are shown to us in Dankers’
pages through slight but extremely vivid
side-lights, but which (having been written
on shipboard) may perhaps be taken with
the grain of palliative salt which should frequently
be cast upon the condemnatory utterances
of sea-weary, if not sea-sick, passengers
on the raging deep when they regard
everything connected with the odious ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
which confines them. We are introduced to
this colonial woman of affairs in the sub-title
of the journal, which states that the journey
to New Netherland was made “in a small
Flute-ship called the Charles, of which
Thomas Singleton was Master; but the
superior Authority over both Ship and Cargo
was in Margaret Filipse, who was the Owner
of both, and with whom we agreed for our
Passage from Amsterdam to New York, in
New Netherland, at seventy-five Guilders for
each Person, payable in Holland.”</p>

<p>This “Margaret Filipse” was the daughter
of Adolph Hardenbrook who settled in Bergen,
opposite New Amsterdam. She was
the widow of the merchant trader Peter
Rudolphus De Vries when she married
Frederick Philipse. Her second husband
was a carpenter by trade, who worked for
Governor Stuyvesant; but on his marriage
with the wealthy Widow De Vries, he became
her capable business partner, and finally
was counted the richest man in the colony.
She owned ships running to many ports, and
went repeatedly to Holland in her own ships
as supercargo. She was visited by Dankers
in Amsterdam in June, 1679. According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
to the custom of his religious sect, he always
called her by her Christian name, and
wrote of her as Margaret. He says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We spoke to Margaret, inquiring of her when
the ship would leave. She answered she had given
orders to have everything in readiness to sail to-day,
but she herself was of opinion it would not be
before Monday. We offered her the money to
pay for our passage, but she refused to receive it
at that time, saying she was tired and could not be
troubled with it that day.”</p>
</div>

<p>They waited patiently on shipboard for
several days for Madam Philipse to embark,
and at last he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We were all very anxious for Margaret to
arrive, so that we might not miss a good wind.
Jan and some of the other passengers were much
dissatisfied. Jan declared, ‘If this wind blows over
I will write her a letter that will make her ears
tingle.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Landing at an English port, the travellers
bought wine and vinegar, “for we began to
see it would go slim with us on the voyage,”
and Margaret bought a ship which was made
ready to go to the Isle of May and then to
the Barbadoes. Over the purchase and
equipment of this ship arose a great quarrel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
for “those miserable, covetous people Margaret
and her husband” tried to take away
the Charles’ long-boat because timber for a
new one was cheaper in New York than in
Falmouth, England. Naturally, the passengers
objected to crossing the Atlantic without
a ship’s-boat. Dankers complained further
of Margaret’s “miserable covetousness,”—that
she made the ship lay to for an hour and
a half and sent out the jolly-boat to pick up
a ship’s mop or swab worth six cents; and
the carpenter swore because she had not furnished
new leather and spouts for the
pumps. Dankers explained at length the
enhancement of the Philipse profits through
some business arrangement and preferment
with the Governor, by which Frederick
Philipse became the largest trader with the
Five Nations at Albany, had a profitable
slave-trade with Africa, and, it is asserted,
was in close bonds with the Madagascar
pirates. Whether “Margaret” favored this
trade with the pirates is not known; but it
could probably be said of her trade, as of
many others in the colony, that it was hard
to draw the dividing line between privateering
and piracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Her calling was not singular in New
Amsterdam. The little town abounded in
women-traders.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Van Es was the daughter of one
of the early Albany magistrates. She married
Gerrit Bancker, and on becoming a
widow removed to New York, where she
promptly opened a store on her own account,
and conducted it with success till her death,
in 1694. In the inventory of her effects were
a share in a brigantine, a large quantity of
goods and peltries, as well as various silver-clasped
Bibles, gold and stone rings, and
silver tankards and beakers, showing her
success in her business career. The wife of
the great Jacob Leisler, a Widow Vanderveen
when he married her, was a trader.
Lysbet, the widow of Merchant Reinier, became
the wife of Domine Drisius, of New
York. She carried on for many years a
thriving trade on what is now Pearl Street,
near Whitehall Street, and was known to
every one as Mother Drisius. The wife of
Domine Van Varick also kept a small store,
and thus helped out her husband’s salary.</p>

<p>Heilke Pieterse was the wife of the foremost
blacksmith of New Amsterdam; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
he monopolized the whole business of Long
Island, he died very rich,—worth at least
ten thousand dollars. Not overwhelmed or
puffed up with the inheritance of such opulence,
Heilke carried on her husband’s business
for many years with success.</p>

<p>Margaret Backer was another successful
business woman. For years she acted as
attorney for her husband while he was in
foreign countries attending to that end of his
great foreign trade. Rachel Vinje, involved
in heavy lawsuits over the settlement of an
estate, pleaded her own case in court, and
was successful. Women were constant in
their appearance in court as parties in contracts
and agreements.</p>

<p>The Schuyler family did not lack examples
of stirring women-kind. Margaret
van Schlictenhorst, wife of the first Peter
Schuyler, being left a widow, managed her
husband’s estate in varied business lines with
such thrift and prudence that in her will,
made at eighty years of age, she could assert
that the property had vastly increased. She
was not out of public affairs, for during the
Leisler troubles she was the second largest
subscriber to the fund in support of the government;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
and she also lent money to pay the
borrowed soldiers. Her niece, Heligonda
van Schlictenhorst, a shrewd spinster, was
a merchant, and furnished public supplies.
The daughter of Peter Schuyler married
John Collins. A letter of his, dated 1722,
shows her capacity. I quote a clause from
it:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since you left us my wife has been in the
Indian country, and Van Slyck had purchased
what he could at the upper end of the land; she
purchased the rest from Ignosedah to his purchase.
She has gone through a great deal of hardship and
trouble about it, being from home almost ever
since you left us; and prevailed with the Indians
whilst there with trouble and expense to mark out
the land where the mine is into the woods. Mrs.
Feathers has been slaving with her all this while,
and hard enough to do with that perverse generation,
to bring them to terms.”</p>
</div>

<p>The picture of these two women in the
wilds, treating and bargaining and trading
with the savages, seems curious enough to
us to-day. Women seem to have excelled in
learning the Indian languages. The daughter
of Anneke Jans was the best interpreter
in the colony, and served as interpreter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Stuyvesant during his famous treaty with the
Six Nations.</p>

<p>Many of the leading taverns or hostelries
were kept by women,—a natural calling, certainly,
for good housewives. Madam Van
Borsum was mistress of the Ferry Tavern in
Breucklen. Annetje Litschar kept the tavern
which stood near the present site of Hanover
Square. Metje Wessell’s hostelry stood on
the north side of Pearl Street, near Whitehall
Street.</p>

<p>More successful still and bold in trade was
Widow Maria Provoost. Scarce a ship came
into port from Holland, England, the Mediterranean,
West Indies, or the Spanish Main,
but brought to her large consignments of
goods. Her Dutch business correspondence
was a large one. She, too, married a second
time, and, as Madam James Alexander, filled
a most dignified position, and became the
mother of Lord Stirling.</p>

<p>In a letter written by her husband, James
Alexander, to his brother William, and dated
October 21, 1721, there is found a passage
which gives extraordinary tribute to her
business capacity and her powers of endurance
alike. It reads thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Two nights agoe at eleven o’clock, my wife
was Brought to bed of a Daughter and is in as
good health as can be Expected, and does more
than can be Expected of any woman, for till
within a few hours of her being brought to bed
She was in her Shop, and ever Since has given the
price of Goods to her prentice, who comes to her
and asks it when Customers come in. The very
next day after She was brought to bed she Sold
goods to above thirty pounds value. And here
the business matters of her Shop which is Generally
Esteemed the best in New York, she with a
prentice of about 16 years of age perfectly well
manages without the Least help from me, you may
guess a little of her success.”</p>
</div>

<p>He closes his letter with a eulogy which
can be cordially endorsed by every reader:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I must say my fortune in America is above my
Expectation, and I think even my Deserts, and
the greatest of my good fortune is in getting so
Good a Wife as I have, who alone would make ae
man easy and happy had he nothing else to depend
on.”</p>
</div>

<p>Madam Alexander accumulated great
wealth, and spent it handsomely. She was
the only person in town, besides the Governor,
who kept a coach. Her will is an
interesting document, and shows a fine style<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
of housekeeping. The enumeration of great
and lesser drawing-rooms, front and back parlors,
blue and gold leather room, green and
gold leather room, tapestry room, chintz
room, etc., show its pretension and extent.
She lived on Broad Street, had a fine garden
laid out in the Dutch taste, a house full of
servants, and spent her money freely as she
made it thriftily. A very good portrait of
her exists. It shows an interesting countenance,
with fine features, a keen eye, and
indicating robust health. She is not dressed
with great elegance, wearing the costume of
the day,—a commonplace frilled cap, folded
kerchief, close sleeves, such as we are familiar
with in portraits of English women of her
time.</p>

<p>Jane Colden, the daughter of Governor
Cadwallader Colden, was of signal service,
not in trade, but in science. A letter written
by her father explains her interest and usefulness:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Botany is an amusement which may be made
agreeable to the ladies who are often at a loss to
fill up their time. Their natural curiosity and the
pleasure they take in the beauty and variety of
dress seem to fit them for it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>
<p>“I have a daughter who has an inclination to
reading, and a curiosity for Natural Philosophy or
Natural History, and a sufficient curiosity for attaining
a competent knowledge. I took the pains
to explain Linnæus’ system, and to put it into an
English form for her use by freeing it from technical
terms, which was easily done, by using two or
three words in the place of one. She is now
grown very fond of the study, and has made such
a progress in it as, I believe, would please you, if
you saw her performance. Though she could not
have been persuaded to learn the terms at first,
she now understands to some degree Linnæus’
characters,—notwithstanding she does not understand
Latin. She has already a pretty large volume
in writing of the description of plants. She
has shewn a method of taking the impression of
the leaves on paper with printers’ ink, by a simple
kind of rolling press which is of use in distinguishing
the species. No description in words alone,
can give so clear an idea, as when assisted with a
picture. She has the impression of three hundred
plants in the manner you’ll see by the samples.
That you may have some conception of her performance,
and her manner of describing, I propose
to enclose some samples in her own writing, some
of which I think are new genera.”</p>
</div>

<p>Peter Collinson said she was the first lady
to study the Linnæan system, and deserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
to have her name celebrated; and John Ellis,
writing of her to Linnæus in 1758, asks that
a genus be named, for her, Coldenella. She
was also a correspondent of Dr. Whyte of
Edinburgh, and many learned societies in
Europe. Walter Rutherfurd enumerates her
talents, and caps them with a glowing tribute
to her cheese-making.</p>

<p>We find the women of the times full of
interest in public affairs and active in good
works. In the later days of the province, we
learn of the gifts to the army at Crown Point
in 1755. In those days the generous farmers
of Queens County, Long Island, collected
one thousand and fifteen sheep, and
these were “cheerfully given.”</p>

<p>“While their husbands at Great Neck
were employed in getting sheep, the good
mothers in that neighborhood in a few hours
collected nearly seventy good large cheeses,
and sent them to New York to be forwarded
with the sheep to the army.” Kings County
defrayed the expense of conveying these
sheep and cheeses to the army; and a letter
of gratitude was promptly returned by the
commander-in-chief. Sir William Johnson,
who said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This generous humanity is unanimously and
gratefully applauded here by all. We pray that
your benevolence may be returned to you by the
great Shepherd of the human kind a thousand fold.
And may those amiable housewives to whose skill
we owe the refreshing cheeses long continue to
shine in their useful and endearing stations.”</p>
</div>

<p>Kings County and Suffolk also sent
cheeses, and we learn also:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Women of County Suffolk ever good in
such Occasions are knitting several large bags of
stockings and mittens to be sent to the poorer soldiers
at Forts William Henry and Edward.”</p>
</div>

<p>In studying the history of the province, I
am impressed with the debt New Yorkers of
Dutch descent owe, not to their forefathers,
but to their foremothers; the conspicuous
decorum of life of these women and their
great purity of morals were equalled by their
good sense and their wonderful capacity in
both domestic and public affairs. They were
as good patriots as they were good business
women; and though they were none of them
what Carlyle calls “writing-women,” it was
not from poverty of good sense or natural
intelligence, but simply from the imperfection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
of their education through lack
of good and plentiful schools, and also want
of stimulus owing to absence of literary
atmosphere.</p>

<p>A very shrewd woman-observer, writing in
the middle of the eighteenth century of the
Dutch, gives what seems to me a very just
estimate and good description of one of their
traits. She says: “Though they have no
vivacity, they are smarter, a great deal
smarter, than the English, that is, more
<i>uptaking</i>.” Those who know the exact
Scotch meaning of “uptaking,” which is
somewhat equivalent to Anthony Trollope’s
“observation and reception,” will understand
the closeness of the application of the term
to the Dutch.</p>

<p>The Dutch women especially were “uptaking;”
adaptive of all comfort-bringing
methods of housekeeping. This was noted
by Guicciardini in Holland as early as 1563.
They were far advanced in knowledge and
execution of healthful household conditions,
through their beautiful cleanliness. Irving
says very truthfully of them: “In those
good days of simplicity and sunshine a passion
for cleanliness was the leading principle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
in domestic economy, and the universal test
of a good housewife.” Kalm says: “They
are almost over nice and cleanly in regard to
the floor, which is frequently scoured twice
a week.” They found conditions of housekeeping
entirely changed in America, but
the passionate love of cleanliness fostered in
the Fatherland clung long in their hearts.
Their “Œconomy” and thrift were also
beautiful.</p>

<p>An advertisement in the “New York
Gazette” of April 1, 1751, shows that the
thrift of the community lingered until Revolutionary
times:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Elizabeth Boyd gives notice that she will as
usual graft Pieces in knit Jackets and Breeches
not to be discern’d, also to graft and foot Stockings,
and Gentlemens Gloves, mittens or Muffatees
made out of old Stockings, or runs them in the
Heels. She likewise makes Childrens Stockings
out of Old Ones.”</p>
</div>

<p>Other dames taught more elegant accomplishments:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Martha Gazley, now in the city of New York,
Makes and Teacheth the following curious Works,
viz.: Artificial Fruit and Flowers and other Wax-Work,
Nun’s Work, Philligree and Pencil-work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
upon Muslin, all sorts of Needlework, and Raising
of Paste, as also to Paint upon Glass, and
Transparent for Sconces with other Works. If any
young Gentlewomen, or others, are inclined to
learn any or all of the above-mentioned curious
Works, they may be carefully taught and instructed
in the same by said Martha Gazley.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Van Cortlandt, in her delightful
account of home-life in Westchester County,
says of the industrious Dutch women and
their accomplishments and occupations:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Knitting was an art much cultivated, the Dutch
women excelling in the variety and intricacy of
the stitches. A knitting sheath, which might be
of silver or of a homely goose-quill, was an indispensable
utensil, and beside it hung the ball-pin-cushion.
Crewel-work and silk embroidery were
fashionable, and surprisingly pretty effects were
produced. Every little maiden had her sampler,
which she began with the alphabet and numerals
following them with a Scriptural text or verse of a
metrical psalm. Then fancy was let loose on
birds, beasts, and trees. Most of the old families
possessed framed pieces of embroidery, the handiwork
of female ancestors. Flounces and trimmings
for aprons worked with delicately tinted
silks on muslin were common. I have several
yards of fine muslin painted in the early days
with full-blown thistles in the appropriate colors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Fringe looms were in use, and cotton and silk
fringes were woven.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tape-looms were also found in many
households; and the weaving of tapes and
“none-so-prettys” was deemed very light
and elegant work.</p>

<p>Though to the Dutch is ascribed the
invention of the thimble, I never think of the
Dutch women as excelling in fine needlework;
and I note that the teachers of intricate and
novel embroidery-stitches are always Englishwomen;
but in turn the English goodwives
must yield to the Dutch the palm of
comfortable, attractive housewifery, as well
as shrewd, untiring business capacity.</p>

<p>The Dutch goodwife worked hard from
early morn till sunset. She worked in restricted
ways, she had few recreations and
pleasures and altogether little variety in her
life; but she possessed what doubtless proved
to her in that day, as it would to any woman
in this day, a source of just satisfaction, a
soothing to the spirit, a staying of melancholy,
a moral support second only to the
solace of religion,—namely, a large quantity
of very good clothes, which were substantial,
cheerful, and suitable, if not elegant.</p>

<p>The Dutch never dressed “in a plaine
habbit according to the maner of a poore
wildernesse people,” as the Connecticut colonists
wrote of themselves to Charles II.;
nor were they weary wanderers in a wilderness
as were Connecticut folk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>I have not found among the statutes of
New Netherland any sumptuary laws such as
were passed in Connecticut, Massachusetts,
and Virginia, to restrain and attempt to prohibit
luxury and extravagance in dress. Nor
have I discovered in the court-records any
evidences of magisterial reproof of finery;
there is, on the contrary, much indirect
proof of encouragement to “dress orderly
and well according to the fashion and the
time.” Of course the Dutch had no Puritanical
dread of over-rich garments; and we
must also never forget New Netherland was
not under the control of a government nor of
a religious band, but of a trading-company.</p>

<p>The ordinary dress of the fair dames and
damsels of New Amsterdam has been vividly
described by Diedrich Knickerbocker; and
even with the additional light upon their
wardrobe thrown by the lists contained in
colonial inventories, I still think his description
of their every-day dress exceedingly
good for one given by a man. He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their hair, untortured by the abominations of
art, was scrupulously pomatumed back from their
foreheads with a candle, and covered with a little
cap of quilted calico, which fitted exactly to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
heads. Their petticoats of linsey-woolsey were
striped with a variety of gorgeous dyes, though I
must confess those gallant garments were rather
short, scarce reaching below the knee; but then they
made up in the number, which generally equalled
that of the gentlemen’s small-clothes; and what is
still more praiseworthy, they were all of their own
manufacture,—of which circumstance, as may well
be supposed, they were not a little vain.</p>

<p>“Those were the honest days, in which every
woman stayed at home, read the Bible, and wore
pockets,—ay, and that, too, of a goodly size, fashioned
with patchwork into many curious devices,
and ostentatiously worn on the outside. These, in
fact, were convenient receptacles where all good
housewives carefully stored away such things as
they wished to have at hand; by which means
they often came to be incredibly crammed.</p>

<p>“Besides these notable pockets, they likewise
wore scissors and pincushions suspended from their
girdles by red ribbons, or, among the more opulent
and showy classes, by a brass and even silver
chains, indubitable tokens of thrifty housewives
and industrious spinsters. I cannot say much in
vindication of the shortness of the petticoats; it
doubtless was introduced for the purpose of giving
the stockings a chance to be seen, which were generally
of blue worsted, with magnificent red clocks;
or perhaps to display a well-turned ankle and a
neat though serviceable foot, set off by a high-heeled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
leathern shoe, with a large and splendid
silver buckle.</p>

<p>“There was a secret charm in those petticoats,
which no doubt entered into the consideration of
the prudent gallants. The wardrobe of a lady
was in those days her only fortune; and she who
had a good stock of petticoats and stockings was
as absolutely an heiress as is a Kamtschatka damsel
with a store of bear-skins, or a Lapland belle with
plenty of reindeer.”</p>
</div>

<p>A Boston lady, Madam Knights, visiting
New York in 1704, wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The English go very fashionable in their dress.
But the Dutch, especially the middling sort, differ
from our women, in their habitt go loose, wear
French muches wch are like a Capp and head-band
in one, leaving their ears bare, which are
sett out with jewells of a large size and many in
number; and their fingers hoop’t with rings, some
with large stones in them of many Coullers, as
were their pendants in their ears, which you should
see very old women wear as well as Young.”</p>
</div>

<p>This really gives a very good picture of
the <i>vrouws</i>; “loose in their habit,” wearing
sacques and loose gowns, not laced in with
pointed waists as were the English and
Boston women; with the ornamental head-dress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
and the gay display of stoned earrings
and rings, which was also not the usual wear
of New England women, who generally
owned only a few funeral rings.</p>

<p>In the inventories of personal estates contained
in the Surrogate’s Court we find details
of the wardrobe; but as I have enumerated
and defined all the different articles at some
length in my book, “Costume of Colonial
Times,” I will not repeat the definitions
here; but it should be remembered that in
the enumeration of the articles of clothing,
many stuffs and materials of simple names
were often of exceedingly good and even rich
quality. From those inventories we have
proof that all Dutch women had plenty of
clothes; while the wives of the burgomasters,
the opulent merchants, and those in
authority, had rich clothes. I have given
in full in my book a list of the clothing of a
wealthy New York dame, Madam De Lange;
but I wish to refer to it again as an example
of a really beautiful wardrobe. In it were
twelve petticoats of varying elegance, some
worth two pounds fifteen shillings each,
which would be more than fifty dollars to-day.
They were of silk lined with silk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
striped stuff, scarlet cloth, and ash-gray cloth.
Some were trimmed with gold lace. With
those petticoats were worn samares and
samares-a-potoso, six in number, which were
evidently jackets or fancy bodies; these
were of calico, crape, “tartanel,” and silk.
One trimmed with lace was worth three
pounds. Waistcoats and bodies also appear;
also fancy sleeves. Love-hoods of silk and
cornet-caps with lace make a pretty head-gear
to complete this costume, with which
was worn the reim or silver girdle with
hanging purse, and also with a handsome
number of diamond, amber, and white coral
jewels.</p>

<p>The colors in the Dutch gowns were
almost uniformly gay,—in keen contrast to
the sad-colored garments of New England.
Madam Cornelia de Vos in a green cloth
petticoat, a red and blue “Haarlamer” waistcoat,
a pair of red and yellow sleeves, and
a purple “Pooyse” apron was a blooming
flower-bed of color.</p>

<p>The dress of Vrouentje Ides Stoffelsen, a
very capable Dutchwoman who went to
Bergen Point to live, varied a little from
that of these town dames. Petticoats she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
had, and waistcoats, bodies and sleeves; but
there was also homelier attire,—purple and
blue aprons, four pairs of pattens, a fur cap
instead of love-hoods, and twenty-three caps.
She wore the simpler and more universal
head-gear,—a close linen or calico cap.</p>

<p>The head covering was of considerable
importance in New Amsterdam, as it was in
Holland as well as in England at that date.
We find that it was also costly. In 1665
Mistress Piertje Jans sold a fine “little ornamental
headdress” for fifty-five guilders to
the young daughter of Evert Duyckinck.
But it seems that Missy bought this “genteel
head-clothes” without the knowledge or
permission of her parents, and on its arrival
at the Duyckinck home Vrouw Duyckinck
promptly sent back the emblem of extravagance
and disobedience. Summoned to
court by the incensed milliner who wished
no rejected head-dresses on her hands, and
who claimed that the transaction was from
the beginning with full cognizance of the
parents, Father Duyckinck pronounced the
milliner’s bill extortionate; and furthermore
said gloomily, with a familiar nineteenth-century
phraseology of New York fathers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
that “this was no time to be buying and
wearing costly head-dresses.” But the court
decided in the milliner’s favor.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that we have no fashion-plates
of past centuries to show to us in
exact presentment the varying modes worn
by New York dames from year to year; that
method of fashion-conveying has been adopted
but a century. The modes in olden days
travelled from country to country, from town
to town, in the form of dolls or “babies,” as
they were called, wearing miniature model
costumes. These dolls were dressed by
cutters and tailors in Paris or London, and
with various tiny modish garments were sent
out on their important mission across the
water. In Venice a doll attired in the last
fashions—the toilette of the year—was for
centuries exhibited on each Ascension Day
at the “Merceria” for the edification of noble
Venetian dames, who eagerly flocked to the
attractive sight. Not less eagerly did American
dames flock to provincial mantua-makers
and milliners to see the London-dressed
babies with their miniature garments. Even
in this century, fashions were brought to
New York and Philadelphia and Albany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
through “milliners’ boxes” containing
dressed dolls. Mrs. Vanderbilt tells of
one much admired fashion-doll of her youth
who had a treasured old age as a juvenile
goddess.</p>

<p>A leading man of New Amsterdam, a burgomaster,
had at the time of his death, near
the end of Dutch rule, this plentiful number
of substantial garments: a cloth coat with
silver buttons, a stuff coat, cloth breeches,
a cloth coat with gimp buttons, a black cloth
coat, a silk coat, breeches and doublet, a
silver cloth breeches and doublet, a velvet
waistcoat with silver lace, a buff coat with
silk sleeves, three “gross-green” cloaks,
several old suits of clothes, linen, hosiery,
silver-buckled shoes, an ivory-headed cane,
and a hat. One hat may seem very little
with so many other garments; but the real
beaver hats of those days were so substantial,
so well-made, so truly worthy an article of
attire, that they could be constantly worn and
yet last for years. They were costly; some
were worth several pounds apiece.</p>

<p>Gayer masculine garments are told of in
other inventories: green silk breeches flowered
with silver and gold, silver gauze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
breeches, yellow fringed gloves, lacquered
hats, laced shirts and neck-cloths, and
(towards the end of the century, and nearly
through the eighteenth century) a vast variety
of wigs. For over a hundred years these
unnatural abominations, which bore no pretence
of resembling the human hair, often
in grotesque, clumsy, cumbersome shapes,
bearing equally fantastic names, and made
of various indifferent and coarse materials,
loaded the heads and lightened the pockets
of our ancestors. I am glad to note that
they were taxed by the government of the
province of New York. The barber and
wig-maker soon became a very important
personage in a community so given over to
costly modes of dressing the head. Advertisements
in the newspapers show the various
kinds of wigs worn in the middle of the
eighteenth century. From the “New York
Gazette” of May 9, 1737, we learn of a thief’s
stealing “one gray Hair Wig, one Horse
hair wig not the worse for wearing, one Pale
Hair Wig, not worn five times, marked V.
S. E., one brown Natural wig, One old wig
of goat’s hair put in buckle.” Buckle
meant to curl; and derivatively a wig was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
buckle when it was rolled on papers for curling.
Other advertisements tell of “Perukes,
Tets, and Fox-tails after the Genteelest
Fashion. Ladies’ Tets and wigs in perfect
imitation of their own hair.” Other curious
notices are of “Orange Butter” for “Gentlewomen
to comb up their hair with.”</p>

<p>This use of orange butter as a pomatum
was certainly unique; it was really a Dutch
marmalade. I read in my “Closet of Rarities,”
dated 1706:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Dutch Way to make Orange-butter.
Take new cream two gallons, beat it up to a
thicknesse, then add half a pint of orange-flower-water,
and as much red wine, and so being become
the thicknesse of butter it has both the colour
and smell of an orange.”</p>
</div>

<p>A very characteristic and eye-catching
advertisement was this from the “New York
Gazette” of May 21, 1750:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is to acquaint the Public, that there is
lately arrived from London the Wonder of the
World, <i>an Honest</i> Barber and Peruke Maker, who
might have worked for the King, if his Majesty
would have employed him: It was not for the
want of Money he came here, for he had enough
of that at Home, nor for the want of Business,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
that he advertises hinself, BUT to acquaint the
Gentlemen and Ladies, That <i>Such a Person is
now in Town</i>, living near <i>Rosemary Lane</i> where
Gentlemen and Ladies may be supplied with
Goods as follows, viz.: Tyes, Full-Bottoms, Majors,
Spencers, Fox-Tails, Ramalies, Tacks, cut
and bob Perukes: Also Ladies Tatematongues
and Towers after the Manner that is now wore
at Court. <i>By their Humble and Obedient Servant</i>,</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">John Still</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>With the change from simple Dutch ways
of hairdressing came in other details more
constrained modes of dressing. With the
wig-maker came the stay-maker, whose
curious advertisements may be read in scores
in the provincial newspapers; and his arbitrary
fashions bring us to modern times.</p>

<p>From the deacons’ records of the Dutch
Reformed Church at Albany we catch occasional
hints of the dress of the children of
the Dutch colonists. There was no poor-house,
and few poor; but since the church
occasionally helped worthy folk who were not
rich, we find the deacons in 1665 and 1666
paying for blue linen for <i>schorteldoecykers</i>,
or aprons, for Albany <i>kindeken</i>; also for
<i>haaken en oogen</i>, or hooks and eyes, for warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
under-waists called <i>borsrockyen</i>. They bought
linen for <i>luyers</i>, which were neither pinning-blankets
nor diapers, but a sort of swaddling
clothes, which evidently were worn then by
Dutch babies. <i>Voor-schooten</i>, which were
white bibs; <i>neerstucken</i>, which were tuckers,
also were worn by little children. Some
little Hans of Pieter had given to him by
the deacons a fine little scarlet <i>aperock</i>, or
monkey-jacket; and other children were
furnished linen <i>cosynties</i>, or night-caps with
capes. Yellow stockings were sold at the
same time for children, and a gay little yellow
turkey-legged Dutchman in a scarlet
monkey-jacket and fat little breeches must
have been a jolly sight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br><span class="small">HOLIDAYS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The most important holidays of the early
years of the colony were, apparently, New
Year’s Day and May Day, for we find them
named through frequent legislation about
rioting on these days, repairing of damages,
etc. It has been said that New Yorkers owe
to the Dutch an everlasting gratitude for our
high-stoop houses and the delights of over
two centuries of New Year’s calling. The
latter custom lived long and happily in our
midst, died a lingering and lamented death, is
still much honored in our memory, and its
extinction deeply deplored and unwillingly
accepted.</p>

<p>The observance of New Year’s Day was,
without doubt, followed by both Dutch and
English from the earliest settlement. We
know that Governor Stuyvesant received
New Year’s calls, and we also know that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
prohibited excessive “drunken drinking,”
unnecessary firing of guns, and all disorderly
behavior on that day. The reign of the
English did not abolish New Year’s visits;
and we find Charles Wolley, an English
chaplain, writing in his journal in New York
in 1701, of the addition of the English custom
of exchange of gifts:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The English in New York observed one
anniversary custom and that without superstition,
I mean the strenarum commercium, as Suetonius
calls them, a neighborly commerce of presents
every New Year’s Day. Some would send me a
sugar-loaf, some a pair of gloves, some a bottle
or two of wine.”</p>
</div>

<p>A further celebration of the day by men
in New York was by going in parties to
Beekman’s Swamp to shoot at turkeys.</p>

<p>New Year’s calling was a new fashion to
General Washington when he came to
New York to live for a short time, but he
adopted it with approval; and his New
Year’s Receptions were imposing functions.</p>

<p>For a long time the New Year was ushered
in, in country towns, with great noise as well
as rejoicing. All through the day groups of
men would go from house to house firing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
salutes, and gathering gradually into large
parties by recruits from each house until the
end of the day was spent in firing at a mark.
The Legislature in March, 1773, attempted to
stop the gun-firing, asserting that “great
damages are frequently done on the eve of
the last day of December and on the first and
second days of January by persons going
from house to house with guns and other
firearms.” In 1785 a similar enactment was
passed by the State Legislature.</p>

<p>In the palmiest days of New Year’s calling,
New York City appeared one great family
reunion. Every wheeled vehicle in the town
seemed to be loaded with visitors going from
house to house. Great four and six horse
stages packed with hilarious mobs of men
went to the house of every acquaintance of
every one in the stage. Target companies
had processions; political bodies called on
families whose head was well known in political
life. The newspaper-carriers brought out
addresses yards long with rhymes:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The day devoted is to mirth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now around the social hearth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Friendship unlocks her genial springs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Harmony her lyre now strings.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">While plenty spreads her copious hoard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And piles and crowns the festive board,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">etc., etc., for hundreds of lines.</p>

<p>The “copious hoard” of substantial food,
with decanters of wine, bowls of milk punch,
and pitchers of egg-nog, no longer “crown the
festive board” on New Year’s Day; but we still
have New Year’s Cakes, though not delivered
by singing bakers’ ’prentices as of yore.</p>

<p>May Day was observed in similar fashion,—by
firing of guns, gay visiting, and also by
the rearing of maypoles.</p>

<p>A very early mention of a maypole is in
June, 1645, when one William Garritse had
“sung a libellous song” against Rev. Francis
Doughty, the preacher at Flushing, Long
Island, and was sentenced in punishment
therefor to be tied to the maypole, which in
June was still standing. Stuyvesant again forbade
“drunken drinking,” and firing of guns
and planting of maypoles, as productive of
bad practices. I don’t know whether the delight
of my childhood, and of generations of
children in Old and New England up to this
present May Day on which I am now writing,—the
hanging of May baskets,—ever made
happy children in New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>There was some observance in New York
of Shrovetide as a holiday-time. As early as
1657 we find the sober Beverwyck burghers
deliberating on “some improprieties committed
at the house of Albert de Timmerman
on Shrovetide last.” As was the inevitable
custom followed by the extremely uninventive
brain of the seventeenth and eighteenth
century rioter, were he Dutch or English,
these “improprieties” took the form of the
men’s parading in women’s clothes; Pieter
Semiensen was one of the masqueraders.
Two years later the magistrates were again
investigating the “unseemly and scandalous”
celebration of Shrovetide; and as ever before,
the youth of early Albany donned women’s
clothes and “marched as mountebanks,” as
the record says, just as they did in Philadelphia
and Baltimore and even in sober Boston.
We find also for sale in Beverwyck at this
time, noisy Shrovetide toys—<i>rommelerytiens</i>,
little “rumbling-pots,” which the youth and
children doubtless keenly enjoyed.</p>

<p>At an early date Shrovetide observances,
such as “pulling the goose,” were prohibited
by Governor Stuyvesant in New York. A
mild protest on the part of some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
burgomasters against this order of the Governor
brought forth one of Stuyvesant’s characteristically
choleric edicts in answer, in
which he speaks of having “interdicted and
forbidden certain farmers’ servants to ride
the goose at the feast of Backus and Shrovetide
... because it is altogether unprofitable,
unnecessary, and criminal for subjects
and neighbors to celebrate such pagan and
popish feasts and to practise such customs,
notwithstanding the same may in some
places of Fatherland be tolerated and looked
at through the fingers.” Domine Blom, of
Kingston or Wyltwyck, joined in the governor’s
dislike of the game. But there were
some of the magistrates who liked very well
to “pull the goose” themselves, so it is said.
It was a cruel amusement. The thoroughly
greased goose was hung between two poles,
and the effort of the sport was to catch,
snatch away, and hold fast the poor creature
while passing at great speed. In Albany in
1677 all “Shrovetide misdemeanors were
prohibited, viz.: riding at a goose, cat, hare,
and ale.” The fine was twenty-five guilders
in sea-want. What the cat, hare, and ale part
of the sport was, I do not know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>In New York by the middle of the eighteenth
century Shrove Tuesday was firmly
assigned to cocking-mains. The De Lanceys
were patrons of this choice old English sport.
Cock-gaffs of silver and steel were freely
offered for sale in New York and Maryland
newspapers, and on Shrove Tuesday in 1770
Jacob Hiltzeheimer attended a famous cock-fight
on the Germantown road. We cannot
blame honest New Yorkers if they did
not rise above such rude sports, when
cock-fighting and cock-throwing and cock-squoiling
and cock-steling obtained everywhere
in Old England at Shrovetide; when
school-boys had cock-fights in their school-rooms;
and in earlier days good and learned
old Roger Ascham ruined himself by betting
on cock-fights, and Sir Thomas More boasted
proudly of his skill in “casting a cock-stele.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gabriel Furman, writing in 1846, told of
an extraordinary observance of Saint Valentine’s
Day by the Dutch—one I think unknown
in folk-lore—which obtained on Long
Island among the early settlers. It was called
<i>Vrouwen dagh</i>, or Women’s day, and was thus
celebrated: Every young girl sallied forth in
the morning armed with a heavy cord with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
knotted end. She gave to every young man
whom she met several smart lashes with the
knotted cord. Perhaps these were “love-taps,”
and were given with no intent of stinging.
Judge Egbert Benson wrote, in 1816,
that in New York this custom dwindled to a
similar Valentine observance by New York
children, when the girls chased the boys with
many blows. In one school the boys asked
for a <i>Mannen dagh</i> in which to repay the
girls’ stinging lashes. I hazard a “wide solution,”
as Sir Thomas Browne says, that this
custom is a commemorative survival of an
event in the life of Saint Valentine, one of the
two traditions which are all we know of his life,
that about the year 270 he was “first beaten
with heavy clubs and then beheaded.”</p>

<p>The English brought a political holiday to
New York. In the code of laws given to the
province in 1665, and known as “The Duke’s
Laws,” each minister throughout the province
was ordered to preach a sermon on November
5, to commemorate the English deliverance
from Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder
Plot in 1605.</p>

<p>From an early entry in the “New York
Gazette” of November 7, 1737, we learn how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
it was celebrated that year, and find that
illuminations, as in England, formed part of
the day’s remembrance. Bonfires, fantastic
processions, and “burning a Guy” formed, in
fact, the chief English modes of celebration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Saturday last, being the fifth of November, it
was observed here in Memory of that horrid and
Treasonable Popish Gun-Powder Plot to blow up
and destroy King, Lords and Commons, and the
Gentlemen of his Majesty’s Council; the Assembly
and Corporation and other the principal Gentlemen
and Merchants of this City waited upon his
Honor the Lieutenant-Governor at Fort George,
where the Royal Healths were drunk, as usual,
under the discharge of the Cannon, and at the
Night the city was illuminated.”</p>
</div>

<p>All through the English provinces bonfires
were burned, effigies were carried in
procession, mummers and masqueraders
thronged the streets and invaded the houses
singing Pope Day rhymes, and volleys of
guns were fired. In some New England
towns the boys still have bonfires on
November 5th.</p>

<p>In the year 1765 the growing feeling
with regard to the Stamp Act chancing to
come to a climax in the late autumn, produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
in New York a very riotous observance
of Pope’s Day. The demonstrations really
began on November 1st, which was termed
“The Last Day of Liberty.” In the evening
a mob gathered, “designing to execute some
foolish ceremony of burying Liberty,” but it
dispersed with noise and a few broken windows.
The next night a formidable mob
gathered, “carrying candles and torches in
their hands, and now and then firing a pistol
at the Effigy which was carried in a Chair.”
Then the effigy was set in the Governor’s
chariot, which was taken out of the Fort.
They made a gallows and hung on it an effigy
of the Governor and one of the Devil, and
carried it to the Fort, over which insult soldiers
and officers were wonderfully patient.
Finally, gallows, chariot and effigies were
all burnt in the Bowling Green. The mob
then ransacked Major James’s house, eating,
drinking, destroying, till £1500 of damage
was done. The next day it was announced
that the delivery and destruction of the
stamps would be demanded. In the evening
the mob started out again, with candles and
a barber’s block dressed in rags. The
rioters finally dispersed at the entreaties of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
many good citizens,—among them Robert R.
Livingstone, who wrote the letter from which
this account is taken. In 1774, November
5th was still a legal holiday.</p>

<p>There still exists in New York a feeble
and divided survival of the processions and
bonfires of Guy Fawkes Day. The police-prohibited
bonfires of barrels on election
night, and the bedraggled parade of begging
boys on Thanksgiving Day are our reminders
to-day of this old English holiday.</p>

<p>There was one old-time holiday beloved
of New Yorkers whose name is now almost
forgotten,—Pinkster Day. This name was
derived from the Dutch word for Pentecost,
and must have been used at a very early
date; for in a Dutch book of sermons, written
by Adrian Fischer, and printed in 1667,
the title of one sermon reads: <i>Het Eersts
Tractact; Van de Uystortnge des Yeyligen
Geests over de Apostelen op ben Pinckster
Dagh</i>,—a sermon upon the story of the
Descent of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles
on Pinkster Day.</p>

<p>The Jewish feast of Pentecost was observed
on the fiftieth day after the celebration of the
Passover, and is the same as the Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
holy-day Whitsunday, which is connected
with its Jewish predecessor historically (as
is so beautifully told in the second chapter
of Acts), and intrinsically through its religious
signification. The week following
Whitsunday has been observed with great
honor and rejoicing in many lands, but in
none more curiously, more riotously, than
in old New York, and to some extent in
Pennsylvania and Maryland; and, more
strangely still, that observance was chiefly
by an alien, a heathen race,—the negroes.
It was one of our few distinctively American
folk-customs, and its story has been told
by many writers of that day, and should not
now be forgotten. Nowhere was it a more
glorious festival than at Albany, among the
sheltered, the cherished slave population in
that town and its vicinity. The celebration
was held on Capitol Hill, then universally
known as Pinkster Hill. Munsell gives
this account of the day:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pinkster was a great day, a gala day, or rather
week, for they used to keep it up a week among
the darkies. The dances were the original Congo
dances as danced in their native Africa. They had
a chief,—Old King Charley. The old settlers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
said Charley was a prince in his own country, and
was supposed to have been one hundred and
twenty-five years old at the time of his death. On
these festivals old Charley was dressed in a strange
and fantastical costume; he was nearly barelegged,
wore a red military coat trimmed profusely with
variegated ribbons, and a small black hat with a
pompon stuck on one side. The dances and antics
of the darkies must have afforded great amusement
for the ancient burghers. As a general thing, the
music consisted of a sort of drum, or instrument
constructed out of a box with sheepskin heads,
upon which old Charley did most of the beating,
accompanied by singing some queer African air.
Charley generally led off the dance, when the
Sambos and Phillises, juvenile and antiquated,
would put in the double-shuffle heel-and-toe break-down.
These festivals seldom failed to attract large
crowds from the city, as well as from the rural
districts.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Eights, of Albany, wrote still further
reminiscences of the day. He said that,
strangely enough, though all the booths and
sports opened on Monday, white curiosity-seekers
were, on that first day, the chief
visitors to Pinkster Hill. On Tuesday the
blacks all appeared, and the consumption of
gingerbread, cider, and applejack began.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Adam Blake, a truly elegant creature, the
body-servant of the old patroon Van Rensselaer,
was master of the ceremonies. Charley,
the King, was a “Guinea man” from
Angola,—and I have noted the fact that
nearly all African-born negroes who became
leaders in this country, or men of marked
note in any way, have been Guinea men.
He wore portions of the costume of a British
general, and had the power of an autocrat,—his
will was law. Dr. Eights says the
Pinkster musical instruments were eel-pots
covered with dressed sheepskin, on which
the negroes pounded with their bare hands,
as do all savage nations on their tom-toms.
Their song had an African refrain, “Hi-a-bomba-bomba-bomba.”
Other authorities
state that the dance was called the “Toto
Dance,” and partook so largely of savage
license that at last the white visitors shunned
being present during its performance.</p>

<p>These Pinkster holidays became such bacchanalian
revels in other ways that in 1811
the Common Council of Albany prohibited
the erection of booths and all dancing, gaming,
and drinking at that time; and when the
negroes could not dance nor drink, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
but a sorry holiday, and quickly fell into
desuetude.</p>

<p>Executions were held on Pinkster Hill,
and other public punishments took place
there.</p>

<p>In the realm of fiction we find evidence of
the glories of Pinkster Day in New York.
Cooper, in his “Satanstoe,” tells of its
observance in New York City. He calls it
the saturnalia of the blacks, and says that
they met on what we now know as City
Hall Park, and that the negroes came for
thirty or forty miles around to join in the
festivities.</p>

<p>On Long Island Pinkster Day was widely
observed. The blacks went, on the week
previous to the celebration, to Brooklyn and
New York to sell sassafras and swingling-tow,
to earn their scanty spending-money for
Pinkster. They were everywhere freely
given their time for rioting, and domestic
labor was performed by the masters and
mistresses; but they had to provide their
own spending-money for gingerbread and
rum. They gathered around the old market
in Brooklyn near the ferry, dancing for eels,
blowing fish-horns, eating and drinking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
The following morning the judge’s office was
full of sorry blacks, hauled up for “disorderly
conduct.”</p>

<p>On Long Island the Dutch residents also
made the day a festival, “going to pinkster
fields for pinkster frolics,” exchanging visits,
and drinking schnapps, and eating “soft-wafels”
together. About twelve years ago,
while driving through Flatlands and New
Lots one beautiful day in May, I met a
group of young men driving from door to
door of the farm-houses, in wagons gayly
dressed with branches of dogwood blossoms,
and entering each house for a short visit. I
asked whether a wedding or a festival were
being held in the town, and was answered
that it was an old Dutch custom to make
visits that week. I tried to learn whence
this observance came, but no one knew its
reason for being, or what holiday was observed.
Poor Pinkster! still vaguely honored
as a shadow, a ghost of the past, but with
your very name forgotten, even among the
children of those who gave to you in this
land a name and happy celebration!</p>

<p>Various wild flowers were known as Pinkster
flowers. The beautiful azalea that once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
bloomed—indeed does still bloom—so
plentifully throughout New York in May,
was universally known as “pinkster flower”
or “pinkster bloom,” and along the banks
of the Hudson till our own day was called
“pinkster blummachee.” The traveller
Kalm noted it in 1740, and called it by that
name. Mrs. Vanderbilt calls it “pinkster
bloomitze.” I was somewhat surprised to
hear a Rhode Island farmer, in the summer
of 1893, ask me whether he should not pick
me “some pinkster blossoms,” pointing at
the same time to the beautiful swamp pink
that flushed with rosy glow the tangles of
vines and bushes on the edge of the Narragansett
woods. It is interesting to know that
by many authorities the name “pink,” of our
common garden flower, is held to be derived
from the Dutch <i>Pinkster</i>, German <i>Pfingsten</i>,
and owes its name, not to its pink color, but
to the season of its blooming. In other
localities in New York and New Jersey the
blue flag or iris was known as “pinkster
bloom.”</p>

<p>Throughout New England the black residents,
free and in bondage, held high holiday
one day in May, or in some localities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
during the first week in June; but the day
of revelry was everywhere called “Nigger
’Lection.” In Puritandom the observance
of Whitsunday was believed to have “superstition
writ on its forehead;” but Election
Day was a popular and properly Puritanical
May holiday; therefore the negro holiday
took a similar name, and the “Black Governor”
was elected on the week following the
election of the white Governor, usually on
Saturday.</p>

<p>There was some celebration of days of
thanksgiving in New Netherland as in Holland;
they were known by a peculiar double
name, fast-prayer and thank-day. These days
did not develop among the Dutch in the
new world into the position of importance
they held among English colonists. In 1644
the first public Thanksgiving Day whose
record has come down to us was proclaimed
in gratitude for the safe return of the Dutch
warriors after a battle with the Connecticut
Indians on Strickland’s Plains near Stamford.
A second Thanksgiving service was announced
for the 6th of September, 1645, whereon God
was to be “specially thanked, praised, and
blessed for suffering” the long-wished-for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
peace with the Indians. This service was
held on Wednesday, which was usually the
chosen day of the week. In 1654, at a
Thanksgiving ordered on account of the
peace established between England and the
Netherlands, services were to be held in
the morning; the citizens were to be permitted
“to indulge in all moderate festivities
and rejoicings as the event recommends
and their Situation Shall permit.” That
these festivities were not always decorous
is shown by the fining and punishment of
some young lads for drunkenness on one
Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>Various were the causes of the commemorative
services: peace between Spain and
the Fatherland; the prosperity of the province,
its peace, increased people, and trade;
a harvest of self-sown grain (the fields having
been deserted for fear of Indians). In 1664
Domine Brown, of Wyltwyck, asked for an
established annual Thanksgiving; but there
are no records to show that this desire was
carried out, though from 1690 to 1710 they
were held almost every year.</p>

</div>


<p>Daniel Denton, one of the original settlers
of Jamaica, Long Island, wrote “A
briefe Description of New York” in 1670.
When he speaks of the “fruits natural to the
island” of Long Island, he ends his account
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Such abundance of strawberries is in June that
the fields and woods are dyed red; which the
country people perceiving, instantly arm themselves
with bottles of wine, cream, and sugar, and instead
of a coat of Mail every one takes a Female upon
his Horse behind him, and so rushing violently
into the fields, never leave till they have disrobed
them of their red colors and turned them into the
old habit.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Rushing violently into the fields” seems
to have been the normal condition of all the
colonists as soon as the tardy American
“spring came slowly up the way.” On every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
hand they turned eagerly to open-air outings.
Houses chafed them; gipsy-like were they
in their love of fresh air and the country
wilds.</p>

<p>In New York were the bouweries close at
hand; and Nutten Island (now Governor’s
Island), “by y<sup>e</sup> making of a garden and planting
severall walks of fruit trees in it,” made
a pretty outing-spot. Mrs. Grant wrote at
length of the Albany youth and their love
of out-of-door excursions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In spring, eight or ten of the young people of
one company, or related to each other, young
men and maidens, would set out together in a
canoe on a kind of rural excursion, of which amusement
was the object. Yet so fixed were their
habits of industry that they never failed to carry
their work-baskets with them, not as a form, but
as an ingredient necessarily mixed with their pleasures.
They had no attendants, and steered a devious
course of four, five, or perhaps more miles,
till they arrived at some of the beautiful islands
with which this fine river abounded, or at some
sequestered spot on its banks, where delicious
wild fruits, or particular conveniences for fishing,
afforded some attraction. There they generally
arrived by nine or ten o’clock, having set out in
the cool and early hour of sunrise.... A basket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
with tea, sugar, and the other usual provisions for
breakfast, with the apparatus for cooking it; a
little rum and fruit for making cool weak punch,
the usual beverage in the middle of the day, and
now and then some cold pastry, was the sole provision;
for the great affair was to depend on the
sole exertions of the boys in procuring fish, wild
ducks, &amp;c., for their dinner. They were all, like
Indians, ready and dexterous with the axe, gun,
&amp;c. Whenever they arrived at their destination,
they sought out a dry and beautiful spot opposite
to the river, and in an instant with their axes
cleared so much superfluous shade or shrubbery as
left a semicircular opening, above which they bent
and twined the boughs, so as to form a pleasant
bower, while the girls gathered dried branches, to
which one of the youths soon set fire with gunpowder,
and the breakfast, a very regular and
cheerful one, occupied an hour or two. The young
men then set out to fish, or perhaps to shoot birds,
and the maidens sat busily down to their work.
After the sultry hours had been thus employed, the
boys brought their tribute from the river or the
wood, and found a rural meal prepared by their
fair companions, among whom were generally their
sisters and the chosen of their hearts. After dinner
they all set out together to gather wild strawberries,
or whatever other fruit was in season; for
it was accounted a reflection to come home empty-handed.
When wearied of this amusement, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
either drank tea in their bower, or, returning,
landed at some friend’s on the way, to partake of
that refreshment.”</p>
</div>

<p>Suburban taverns were much resorted to at
a little later date by all town-folk, and “ladies
and gentlemen were entertained in the genteelest
manner.” New Yorkers specially liked
the fish-dinners furnished at an inn perched
on Brooklyn Heights; and twice a week they
could drive to a turtle-feast at a beloved
retreat on the East River, always taking much
care to return over the Kissing Bridge, where,
says with approval a reverend gentleman, a
traveller of ante-Revolutionary days, “it is
part of the etiquette to salute the lady who
has put herself under your protection.”
More idyllic still was the rowing across the
river to Brooklyn, to the noble tulip-tree near
the ferry, with its great spreading shadowy
branches, so cool in summer suns, and glorious
with tropical blooms, and hospitable with
a vast shining hollow trunk which would hold
six or eight happy summer revellers within
the sheltering walls. Would I could sing The
Tulip-Tree as Cowper did The Sofa; with its
happy summer groups, its beauty, its pathetic
end, and the simple joys it sheltered,—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
extinct as the species to which the tree itself
belongs!</p>

<p>Occasional glimpses of pretty country
hospitality in country homes are afforded
through old-time letters. One of the Rutherfurd
letters reads:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We were very elegantly entertained at the
Clarks’, and everything of their own production.
By way of amusement after dinner we all went
into the garden to pick roses. We gathered a
large basket full, and prepared them for distilling.
As I had never seen Rose-water made, Mrs. Clark
got her still and set it going, and made several
bottles while we were there. They were extremely
civil, and begged us whenever we rode that way in
the evening to stop and take a syllabub with
them.”</p>
</div>

<p>This certainly presents a very dainty scene;
the sweet June rose-garden, the delicate
housewifery, the drinking of syllabubs make
it seem more French than plain New York
Dutch in tone and color.</p>

<p>The Dutch were no haters of games as
were the Puritans; games were known and
played even in the time of the first settlers.
Steven Janse had a <i>tick-tack bort</i> at Fort
Orange. Tick-tack was a complicated kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
of backgammon, played with both men and
pegs. “The Compleat Gamester” says tick-tack
is so called from touch and take, for if
you touch a man you must play him though
to your loss. “Tick-tacking” was prohibited
during time of divine service in New Amsterdam
in 1656. Another Dutch tapster had a
trock-table, which Florio says was “a kind of
game used in England with casting little
bowles at a boord with thirteen holes in it.”
A trock-table was a table much like a
pool table, on which an ivory ball was struck
under a wire wicket by a cue. Trock was
also played on the grass,—a seventeenth-century
modification of croquet. Of bowling
we hear plenty of talk; it was universally
played, from clergy down to negro slaves,
and a famous street in New York, the Bowling
Green, perpetuates its popularity. The
English brought card-playing and gaming, to
which the Dutch never abandoned themselves.</p>

<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century
we find more amusements and a gayer life.
The first regularly banded company of comedians
which played in New York strayed
thence from Philadelphia in March, 1750,
where they had been bound over to good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
behavior, and where their departure had
given much joy to a disgusted Quaker community.
It was called Murray and Kean’s
company, and sprung up in Philadelphia like
a toadstool in a night, from whence or how
no one knows. The comedians announced
their “sitting down” in New York for the
season. They opened with King Richard
III., “written by Shakespeare and improved
by Colley Cibber.” They also played “The
Beau in the Sudds,” “The Spanish Fryer,”
“The Orphan,” “The Beau’s Stratagem,”
“The Constant Couple,” “The Lying Valet,”
“The Twin Rivals,” “Colin and Phœbe,”
“Love for Love,” “The Stagecoach,”
“The Recruiting Officer,” “Cato,” “Amphitryon,”
“Sir Harry Wildair,” “George
Barnwell,” “Bold Stroke for a Wife,”
“Beggar’s Opera,” “The Mock Doctor,”
“The Devil to Pay,” “The Fair Penitent,”
“The Virgin Unmasked,” “Miss in her
Teens,” and a variety of pantomimes and
farces. This was really a very good series of
bills, but the actors were a sorry lot. One
was a redemptioner, Mrs. Davis, and she had
a benefit to help to buy her freedom; another
desired a benefit, as he was “just out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
prison.” They were in town ten months, and
seem to have been on very friendly terms
with the public, borrowing single copies of
plays to study from, having constant benefits,
ending with one for Mr. Kean, in which one
Mrs. Taylor was “out so much in her part”
that she had to be apologized for afterwards
in the newspapers. She had a benefit shortly
after, at which, naturally and properly, there
“wasn’t much company.” Miss George at
her benefit had bad weather and other disappointments,
and tried it over again. At
last Mr. Kean, “by the advice of several
Gentlemen having resolv’d to quit the stage
and follow his Employment of writing and
hopes for Encouragement,” sold his half of
“his cloaths” and the stage effects for a
benefit, at which if the house had been full to
overflowing the whole receipts would not
have been more than two hundred and fifty
dollars. John Tremain also “declined the
stage” and went to cabinet-making,—“plain
and scallopt tea-tables, etc.,”—which was very
sensible, since tea was more desired than the
drama. A new company sprung up, but
“mett with small encouragement,” though
the company “assured the Publick they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Perfect and hope to Perform to Satisfaction.”
Perhaps the expression “the Part of Lavinia
will be <i>Attempted</i> by Mrs. Tremain” was a
wise one. All this was at a time when a
good theatrical company could easily have
been obtained in England, where the art of
the actor was at a high standard.</p>

<p>We gain a notion of some rather trying
manners at these theatres. The English custom
of gentlemen’s crowding on the stage
increased to such an extent, and proved so
deleterious to any good representation of the
play, that the manager advertised in “Gaines’
Mercury,” in 1762, that no spectators would
be permitted to stand or sit on the stage
during the performance. And also a reproof
was printed to “the person so very rude as
to throw Eggs from the Gallery upon the
stage, to the injury of Cloaths.”</p>

<p>For some years a Mr. Bonnin, a New York
fishmonger, entertained his fellow-citizens
and those of neighboring towns with various
scientific exhibits, lectures, camera obscuras,
“prospects” and “perspectives,” curious animals,
“Philosophical-Optical machines” and
wax-works, and manifold other performances,
which he ingeniously altered and renamed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
He was a splendid advertiser. The newspapers
of the times contain many of his
attempts to catch the public attention. I give
two as an example:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We hear that Mr. Bonnin is so crouded with
company to view his Perspectives, that he can
scarce get even so much time as to eat, drink or
say his Prayers, from the time he gets out of bed
till He repairs to it again: and it is the Opinion
of some able Physicians that if he makes rich, it
must be at the Expense of the Health of his Body,
and of some Learned Divines it must be at the
Expense of the Welfare of His Soul.”</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The common topics of discourse here since
the coming of Mr. Bonnin are entirely changed.
Instead of the common chat nothing is scarce
mentioned now but the most entertaining parts of
Europe which are represented so lively in Mr.
Bonnin’s curious Prospects.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bonnin is now but a shadow of the
past, vanished like his puppets into nowhere;
in his own far “perspective” of a century
and a half, he seems to me amusing; at any
rate, he was all that New Yorkers had many
times to amuse them; and I think he must
have been a jolly lecturer, when he was such
a jolly advertiser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>Also in evidence before the public was one
Pachebell, a musician. The following is one
of his advertisements in the year 1734:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Wednesday the 21st of January instant
there will be a Consort of music, vocal and instrumental
for the benefit of Mr. Pachebell, the harpsicord
parts performed by himself. The songs,
violins and German flutes by private hands. The
Consort will begin precisely at six o’clock in the
house of Robert Todd vintner. Tickets to be had
at the Coffee House at 4 shillings.”</p>
</div>

<p>Amateurs often performed for his benefit,
and even portions of oratorios were “attempted.”
His “consorts” were said to be
ravishing, and inspired the listeners to rhapsodic
poesy, which is more than can be said
of many concerts nowadays. Those who
know the “thin metallic thrills” of a harpsichord—an
instrument with no resonance, mellowness,
or singing quality—can reflect upon
the susceptibility of our ancestors, who could
melt into sentiment and rhyme over those
wiry vibrations.</p>

<p>The favorite winter amusement in New
York, as in Philadelphia, was riding in sleighs,
a fashion which the Dutch brought from Holland.
The English colonists in New England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
were slower to adopt sleighs for carriages,
and never in early days found sleighing a
sport. The bitter New England weather did
not attract sleighers.</p>

<p>Madam Knights, a Boston visitor to New
York, wrote in 1704:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their diversion in winter is riding in sleighs
about three miles out of town, where they have
houses of entertainment at a place called the
Bowery; and some go to friends’ houses, who
handsomely treat them. I believe we mett fifty or
sixty sleighs one day; they fly with great swiftness,
and some are so furious that they turn out
for none except a loaded cart.”</p>
</div>

<p>An English parson, one Burnaby, visiting
New York in 1759, wrote of their delightful
sleighing-parties; and Mrs. Anne Grant thus
adds her testimony of similar pleasures in
Albany:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In winter the river, frozen to a great depth,
formed the principal road through the country,
and was the scene of all those amusements of
skating and sledge races, common to the north
of Europe. They used in great parties to visit
their friends at a distance, and having an excellent
and hardy breed of horses, flew from place to
place over the snow or ice in these sledges with
incredible rapidity, stopping a little while at every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
house they came to, and always well received
whether acquainted with the owners or not. The
night never impeded these travellers, for the atmosphere
was so pure and serene, and the snow
so reflected the moon and star-light, that the
nights exceeded the days in beauty.”</p>
</div>

<p>William Livingstone, when he was twenty-one
years old, wrote in 1744 of a “waffle-frolic,”
which was an amusement then in
vogue:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had the wafel-frolic at Miss Walton’s
talked of before your departure. The feast as
usual was preceded by cards, and the company so
numerous that they filled two tables; after a few
games, a magnificent supper appeared in grand
order and decorum, but for my own part I was
not a little grieved that so luxurious a feast should
come under the name of a wafel-frolic, because if
this be the case I must expect but a few wafel-frolics
for the future; the frolic was closed up
with <i>ten sunburnt virgins lately come from Columbus’s
Newfoundland</i>, besides a play of my own
invention which I have not room enough to describe
at present. How’ever, kissing constitutes a
great part of its entertainment.”</p>
</div>

<p>Kissing seemed to constitute a great part
of the entertainment at evening parties everywhere
at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the English obtained control of
New York, they established English sports and
pastimes, among them fox-hunting. Long
Island afforded good sport. During the
autumn three days’ hunting was permitted
at Flatbush; in other towns the chase was
stolen fun. A woman-satirist, with a spirited
pen, had her fling in rhyme at fox-hunting.
Here are a few of her lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A fox is killed by twenty men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That fox perhaps had killed a hen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A gallant art no doubt is here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All wicked foxes ought to fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When twenty dogs and twenty men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can kill a fox that killed a hen.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fox-hunting was never very congenial,
apparently, to those of Dutch descent and
Dutch characteristics; nor was cock-fighting,
the prevalence of which I have noted in the
preceding chapter. Occasionally we hear of
the cruel sport of bull-baiting, though not till
the latter half of the eighteenth century. In
1763 the keeper of the DeLancey Arms on
the Bowery Lane gave a bull-baiting. Brooklyn
was specially favored in that respect during
the Revolution, when the British officers
took charge of and enjoyed the barbarism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
and Landlord Loosely of the King’s Head
Tavern helped in the arrangements and advertising.
Good active bulls and strong
dogs were in much demand. The newspapers
of the times contain many advertisements
of the sport. One in poor rhyme
begins:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This notice gives to all who covet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Baiting the bull and dearly love it.” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I frequently recall, as I pass through a quiet
street near my home, that in the year 1774 a
bull-baiting was held there every afternoon
for many months, and I resolutely demolish
that hollow idol—the good old times—and
rejoice in humane to-day.</p>

<p>As early as 1665 Governor Nicholls announced
that a horse-race would take place
at Hempstead, “not so much for the divertissement
of youth as for encouraging the bettering
of the breed of horses which through
great neglect has been impaired.” In 1669
Governor Lovelace gave orders that a race
should be run in May each year, and that
subscriptions should be sent to Captain Salisbury,
“of all such as are disposed to run for
a crown in silver or the value thereof in
wheat.” This first course was a naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
level plain called Salisbury Plains, and was
so named after this very Captain Silvester
Salisbury, Commander of Royal Troops in
the province, and an enthusiastic sportsman.
Its location was near the present Hyde Park
station of Long Island.</p>

<p>Daniel Denton, one of the early settlers
of Jamaica, Long Island, wrote in 1670
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Towards the middle of Long Island lieth a
plain sixteen miles long and four broad, upon
which plain grows very fine grass that makes exceeding
good hay; where you shall find neither
stick nor stone to hinder the horse-heels, or endanger
them in their races, and once a year the
best horses in the island are brought hither to
try their Swiftness and the swiftest rewarded with
a silver Cup, two being Annually procured for
the Purpose.”</p>
</div>

<p>The “fine grass” was what was known as
secretary grass, and, curiously enough, this
great plain was abandoned to this growth of
secretary grass for more than a century after
the settlement and cultivation of surrounding
farms; this was through a notion that the
soil was too porous to be worth ploughing.
Even a clergyman sent out by the Society for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign
Parts testified to the beauty of Salisbury
Plain, calling it “an even delightsome plain,
most sweet and pleasant.” Delightsome it
certainly proved to lovers of horse-racing.</p>

<p>On February 24, 1721, a race was held on
this plain which attracted much attention.
The winning horse was owned by Samuel
Bayard. The race was given by “the inhabitants
of Queens County on Nassau Island.”
The name of the course had by this time
been changed to Newmarket. In 1764 a
new course was laid out; and in 1804 the
racing moved to a field east of the Old Court
House, and in 1821 it was transferred to the
Union Course on the western border of
Jamaica. The story of this course is familiar
to sportsmen.</p>

<p>Frequent newspaper notices call attention
to the races held at this Hempstead Newmarket.
From the “New York Postboy” of
June 4, 1750, I quote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Friday last there was a great horse race
on Hempstead Plains which engaged the attention
of so many of the city of New York that upwards
of seventy chairs and chaises were carried over
Brooklyn Ferry the day before, besides a far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
greater number of horses. The number of horses
on the plains exceeded, it is thought, one
thousand.”</p>
</div>

<p>In 1764 we find the Macaroni Club offering
prizes of £100 and £50. At those races
Mr. James De Lancey’s bay horse Lath won.
On September 28, 1769, the same horse Lath
won a £100 race in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In October, 1770, Jacob Hiltzheimer, a well-known
lover and breeder of horses in Philadelphia,
went to the races on Hempstead
Plains, and lodged at a “public house” in
Jamaica, with various other gentlemen,—lovers
of races. Two purses of £50 were
given, but Mr. Hiltzheimer’s chestnut horse
Regulus did not win.</p>

<p>A London racing-book of 1776 says of
this Hempstead course:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These plains were celebrated for their races
throughout all the Colonies and even in England.
They were held twice a year for a silver cup, to
which the gentry of New England and New York
resorted.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another famous race-course of colonial
days was the one-mile course around Beaver
Pond in Jamaica. This was laid out before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the year 1757, for on June 13 of that year
a subscription plate was won by Lewis Morris,
Jr., with his horse American Childers.
Another course was at Newtown in 1758, and
another at New Lots in 1778.</p>

<p>I find frequent allusions in the colonial press
to the Beaver Pond course. The “New York
Mercury” of 1763 tells of a “Free Masons’
Purse”—for best two in three heats, each
heat three times round Beaver Pond—free-masons
were to be “inspectors” of this
race.</p>

<p>At the time of the possession of Brooklyn
and western Long Island by the British
during the Revolutionary War, there constantly
went on a succession of sporting
events of all kinds under the direction of the
English officers and a notorious tavern-keeper
Loosely, already named, who seemed
to devote every energy to the amusement of
the English invaders. An advertisement in
“Rivington’s Gazette” November 4, 1780,
reads thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By Permission Three Days’ Sport on Ascot
Heath formerly Flatlands Plain on Monday.
1. The Noblemen’s and Gentlemen’s Purse of
£60 free for any horse except Mr. Wortman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
and Mr. Allen’s Dulcimore who won the plate at
Beaver Pond last season. 2. A Saddle, bridle,
and whip, worth £15 for ponies not exceeding
13¹⁄₂ hands. Tuesday. 1. Ladies’ Subscription
Purse of £50. 2. To be run for by women, a
Holland smock and Chintz Gown full-trimmed;
to run the two in three quarter-miles; first to
have the smock and gown of four guineas value;
second, a guinea; third half a guinea. Wednesday.
Country Subscription Purse of £50. No
person will erect a booth or sell liquor without
subscribing 2 guineas to expenses of races. Gentlemen
fond of fox-hunting will meet at Loosely’s
Kings Head Tavern at day break during the
races. God Save the King played every hour.”</p>
</div>

<p>It will be seen by this advertisement that
the rough and rollicking ways of English
holidays were introduced in this woman’s-race.
The women who ran those quarter-miles
must have been some camp-followers,
for I am sure no honest Long Island country-girls
would have taken part. At other races
on this freshly named “Ascot Heath” hurling-matches
and bull-baitings and lotteries
added their zest, and on April 27, 1782,
there was a three hundred guineas sweep-stakes
race. These races were held at short
intervals until October, 1783, when English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
sports and English cruelties no longer held
sway on Long Island.</p>

<p>At these races, given under martial rule,
some rather crooked proceedings were taken
to recruit the field and keep up the interest;
and good horses for many miles around were
watched carefully by their owners; and when
a gentleman attending the races viewed with
surprised and indignant recognition his own
horse which had been stolen from him, he
promptly applied for restitution to Mr. Cornell,
of Brooklyn, who had entered the horse;
and when the race was finished, the horse was
returned to its rightful owner.</p>

<p>Other localities developed race-courses.
“At Captain Tim Cornell’s Poles, on Hempstead
Plains,” Eclipse and Sturdy Beggar
ran for “Fifty Joes” on March 14, 1781. In
1783 Eclipse and Young Slow and Easy ran
for a purse of two hundred guineas. At Far
Rockaway, in 1786, Jacob Hicks, “from a
wish to gratify sportsmen,” laid out a mile
course and offered prizes where no “trussing,
jostling, or foul play were countenanced; if
detected, the rider will be pronounced
distanced.”</p>

<p>On Manhattan Island were several other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
race-courses. In 1742, a race was run on
the Church Farm, just a stone’s throw north-west
of where the Astor House now stands.
I have seen many notices of races on this
Church Farm which was the valuable Trinity
Church property. In October, 1726, a Subscription
Plate of twenty pounds was run for
“on the Course at New York.” The horses
were entered with Francis Child on Fresh
Water Hill. Entrance fee was half a pistole.
Admission to the public, sixpence each.
In the 1750 October runs, Mr. Lewis Morris,
Jr.’s horse won on the Church Farm course.
The chief racing stables in the province of
New York were those of Mr. Morris and of
Mr. James De Lancey. The former won a
reputation with American Childers; the
latter with his imported horse Lath. The
De Lancey stables were the most costly ones
in the north; their colors were seen on every
course for ten years previous to the Revolution,
and they were patrons of all English
sports. A famous horse of James De Lancey’s
was True Briton. It is told of this
horse that Oliver De Lancey would jump
him back and forth from a standstill over
a five-barred gate. There was a course at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Greenwich Village on the estate of Sir
Peter Warren, and one at Harlem, another
at Newburgh.</p>

<p>Many advertisements of other races with
names of horses and owners might be added
to this list; but I think I have given a sufficient
number to disprove the vague assertions
of Frank Forester and other writers of the
history of the horse in America, that little
attention was paid to horse-raising in the
northern provinces, and that there were a few
races on Long Island previous to the Revolution,
but it is not known whether taking
place regularly, or for given prizes. There
was no racing-calendar in America till 1829,
but there are other ways of learning of
races.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br><span class="small">CRIMES AND PUNISHMENTS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The court records of any period in our
American history are an unfailing source of
profit and delight to the historian. In the
town or state whose colonial records still
exist there can ever be drawn a picture not
only of the crimes and punishments, but of
the manners, occupations, and ways of our
ancestors and a knowledge can be gained of
the social ethics, the morality, the modes of
thought, the intelligence of dead-and-gone
citizens. We learn that they had daily
hopes and plans and interests and harassments
just such as our own, as well as vices
and wickedness.</p>

<p>In spite of Chancellor Kent’s assertion of
their dulness and lack of interest, the court
records of Dutch colonial times are not to
me dull reading; quaint humor and curious
terms abound; the criminal records always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
are interesting; even the old <i>reken-boeks</i>
(the account-books) are of value. These
first sources give an unbiassed and well-outlined
picture, sometimes a surprising and
almost irreconcilable one; for instance, I
had always a fixed notion that the early
women-colonists of Dutch birth were wholly
a quiet, reserved, even timid group; not
talkative and never aggressive. It was therefore
a great thrust at my established ideas to
discover, when poring over an old “Road
Book” at the Hall of Records in Brooklyn,
containing some entries of an early Court of
Sessions, an account of the trial of two dames
of Bushwyck, Mistress Jonica Schampf and
Widow Rachel Luquer, for assaulting the
captain of the Train-Band, Captain Peter
Praa, on training-day in October, 1690,
while he was at the head of his company.
These two vixens most despitefully used him;
they beat him, pulled his hair, assaulted and
wounded him, and committed “other Ivill
Inormities, so that his life was despaired of.”
And there was no evidence to show that any
of his soldiers, or any of the spectators present,
interfered to save either Peter’s life or
his honor. The offence which provoked this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
assault is not even hinted at, though it may
have arisen from the troubled state of public
affairs. Captain Praa was a man of influence
and dignity in the community, an exiled
Huguenot, of remarkable skill in horsemanship
and arms. In spite of all this, it appears
probable that the sentiment of the community
was in sympathy with the two turbulent
assaulters and batterers, for they were fined
only six shillings and three pounds respectively.
They threw themselves on the mercy
of the Court, and certainly were treated with
mercy.</p>

<p>There are, however, few women-criminals
named in the old Dutch and early English
records, and these few were not prosecuted
for any very great crimes or viciousness; the
chief number were brought up for defamation
of character and slander, though men-slanderers
were more plentiful than women.
The close intimacy, the ideal neighborliness
of the Dutch communities of New York made
the settlers deeply abhor all violations of
the law of social kindness. To preserve this
state of amity, they believed with Chaucer
“the first vertue is to restraine and kepen
wel thine tonge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>The magistrates knew how vast a flame
might be kindled by a petty spark; and therefore
promptly quenched the odious slander in
its beginning; petty quarrels were adjusted by
arbitration ere they grew to great breaches.
As sung the chorus of Batavian women in
Van der Vondel’s great poem:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If e’er dispute or discord dared intrude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas soon by wisdom’s voice subdued.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In spite, however, of all wariness and
watchfulness and patience, the inevitable
fretfulness engendered in petty natures by
a narrow and confined life showed in neighborhood
disputes and suits for defamation
of character, few of them of great seriousness
and most of them easily adjusted by the
phlegmatic and somewhat dictatorial Dutch
magistrates. In a community so given to
nicknaming it seems strange to find such
extreme touchiness about being called names.
Suits for defamation were frequent, through
opprobrious name-calling, and on very slight
though irritating grounds. It would certainly
seem a rather disproportionate amount
of trouble to bring a lawsuit simply because
you were called a “black pudding,” or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
<i>verklickker</i>, or tale-bearer, or even a “Turk;”
though, of course, no one would stand being
called a “horned beast” or a “hay thief.”
Nor was “Thou swine” an offensive term
too petty to be passed over in silence. The
terrible epithets, <i>spitter-baard</i> and “Dutch
dough-face,” seem to make a climax of opprobriousness;
but the word <i>moff</i> was worse,
for it was the despised term applied in Holland
to the Germans, and it led to a quarrel
with knives.</p>

<p>I wish to note in passing that though the
Dutch called each other these disagreeable
and even degrading names, they did not
swear at each other. Profanity was seldom
punished in New Amsterdam, for practically
it did not exist, as was remarked by travellers.
Chaplain Wolley told of “the usual
oath” of one Dutch colonist,—the word
“sacrament.”</p>

<p>The colonists were impatient of insulting
actions as well as words. Sampson said in
“Romeo and Juliet,” “I will bite my thumb
at them, which is a disgrace to them <i>if they
bear it</i>;” so “finger-sticking” was a disgrace
in colonial times <i>if unresented</i>, and it was
actionable in the courts. The man or woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
who pointed the finger of scorn at a neighbor
was pretty sure to have the finger of the law
pointed at him.</p>

<p>The curious practice of the Dutch settlers
alluded to—the giving of nicknames—may
be partly explained by the fact that in some
cases the persons named had no surname, and
the nickname was really a distinguishing
name. These nicknames appear not only in
the records of criminal cases, but in official
documents such as the patents for towns,
transfers of estates, civil contracts, etc. In
Albany, in 1655 and 1657, we find Jan the
Jester, Huybert the Rogue, Jacobus or Cobus
the Looper, squint-eyed Harmen, the wicked
Domine. On Long Island were John the
Swede, Hans the Boor, Tunis the Fisher.
In Harlem was Jan Archer the Koop-all (or
buy-all). In New York, in English days, in
1691, we find Long Mary, Old Bush, Top-knot
Betty, Scarebouch. These names conveyed
no offence, and seem to have been universally
adopted and responded to.</p>

<p>It would appear to a casual observer glancing
over the court-records of those early
years of New York life under Dutch supremacy,
that the greater number of the cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
brought before the magistrates were these
slander and libel cases. We could believe
that no other court-room ever rang with such
petty personal suits; to use Tennyson’s
words, “it bubbled o’er with gossip and
scandal and spite.” But in truth slander was
severely punished in all the colonies, in New
England, Virginia, Pennsylvania; and it is
not to the detriment of the citizens of New
Netherland that they were more sharp in the
punishment of such offences, for it is well
known, as Swift says, that the worthiest
people are those most injured by slander.</p>

<p>The slander cases of colonial times seem
most trivial and even absurd when seen
through the mist of years. They could scarce
reach the dignity of Piers Plowman’s definition
of slanders:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To bakbyten, and to bosten, and to bere fals witnesse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To scornie and to scolde, sclaundres to make.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To show their character, let me give those
recorded in which Thomas Applegate of
Gravesend, Long Island, took an accused
part. In 1650, he was brought up before the
Gravesend court for saying of a fellow-towns-man
that “he thought if his debts were paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
he would have little left.” For this incautious
but not very heinous speech he paid a
fine of forty guilders. The next year we find
him prosecuted for saying of a neighbor
that “he had not half a wife.” Though he at
first denied this speech, he was ordered “to
make publick acknowledgement of error; to
stand at the publick post with a paper on his
breast mentioning the reason, that he is a
notorious, scandalous person.” This brought
him to his senses, and he confessed his guilt,
desired the slandered “half a wife” to “pass
it by and remit it, which she freely did and
he gave her thanks.” Next Mistress Applegate
was brought up for saying that a neighbor’s
wife milked the Applegate cows. She
escaped punishment by proving that Penelope
Prince told her so. As a climax, Thomas
Applegate said to a friend that he believed
that the Governor took bribes. The <i>schout</i>
in his decision on this grave offence said
Applegate “did deserve to have his tongue
bored through with a hot iron;” but this
fierce punishment was not awarded him, nor
was he banished.</p>

<p>When the tailor of New Amsterdam said
disrespectful words of the Governor, his sentence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
was that he “stand before the Governor’s
door with uncovered head, after the
ringing of the bell, and to declare that he
falsely and scandalously issued such words
and then to ask God’s pardon.”</p>

<p>The magistrates were very touchy of their
dignity. Poor Widow Piertje Jans had her
house sold on an execution; and, exasperated
by the proceeding, and apparently also at the
price obtained, she said bitterly to the
officers, “Ye despoilers, ye bloodsuckers, ye
have not sold but given away my house.”
Instead of treating these as the heated words
of a disappointed and unhappy woman, the
officers promptly ran tattling to the Stadt
Huys and whiningly complained to the Court
that her words were “a sting which could not
be endured.” Piertje was in turn called
shameful; her words were termed “foul,
villanous, injurious, nay, infamous words,”
and also called a blasphemy, insult, affront,
and reproach. She was accused of insulting,
defaming, affronting, and reproaching the
Court, and that she was in the highest degree
reprimanded, particularly corrected, and
severely punished; and after being forbidden
to indulge in any more such blasphemies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
she was released,—“bethumped with words,”
as Shakespeare said,—doubtless well scared at
the enormity of her offence, as well as at the
enormity of the magistrate’s phraseology.</p>

<p>The notary Walewyn van der Veen was
frequently in trouble, usually for contempt
of court. And I doubt not “the little bench
of justices” was sometimes rather trying in
its ways to a notary who knew anything about
law. On one occasion, when a case relating
to a bill of exchange had been decided against
him, Van der Veen spoke of their High
Mightinesses the magistrates as “simpletons
and blockheads.” This was the scathing
sentence of his punishment:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That Walewyn Van der Veen, for his committed
insult, shall here beg forgiveness, with uncovered
head, of God, Justice, and the Worshipful
Court, and moreover pay as a fine 190 guilders.”</p>
</div>

<p>This fine must have consumed all his fees for
many a weary month thereafter, if we can
judge by the meagre lawyers’ bills which
have come down to us.</p>

<p>Another time the contumacious Van der
Veen called the Secretary a rascal. Thereat,
the latter, much aggrieved, demanded “honorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
and profitable reparation” for the insult.
The <i>schout</i> judged this epithet to be
a slander and an affront to the Secretary,
which “affected his honor, being tender,”
and the honor of the Court as well, since it
was to a member of the Court, and he demanded
that the notary should pay a fine of
fifty guilders as an example to other slanderers,
“who for trifles have constantly in
their mouths curses and abuses of other honorable
people.”</p>

<p>Another well-known notary and practitioner
and pleader in the busy little Court
held in the Stadt Huys was Solomon La
Chair. His manuscript volume of nearly
three hundred pages, containing detailed accounts
of all the business he transacted in
Manhattan, is now in the County Clerk’s
Office in New York, and proves valuable
material for the historiographer. He had
much business, for he could speak and write
both English and Dutch; and he was a faithful,
painstaking, intelligent worker. He not
only conducted lawsuits for others, but he
seems to have been in constant legal hot
water himself on his own account. He was
sued for drinking and not paying for a can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
of sugared wine; and also for a half-aam of
costly French wine; and he was sued for the
balance of payment for a house he had purchased;
he pleaded for more time, and with
the ingenuous guilelessness peculiar to the
law said in explanation that he had had the
money gathered at one time for payment,
but it had somehow dropped through his
fingers. “The Court condemned to pay at
once,”—not being taken in by any such
simplicity as that. He had to pay a fine of
twelve guilders for affronting both fire inspector
and court messenger. He first insulted
the <i>brandt-meester</i> who came to inspect
his chimney, and was fined, then he called
the <i>bode</i> who came to collect the fine “a little
cock booted and spurred.” The Court in
sentence said with dignity, “It is not meet
that men should mock and scoff at persons
appointed to any office, yea a necessary
office.”</p>

<p>He won one important suit for the town of
Gravesend, by which the right of that town to
the entire region of Coney Island was established;
and he received in payment for his
legal services therein, the munificent sum of
twenty-four florins (ten dollars) paid in gray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
pease. He kept a tavern and was complained
of for tapping after nine o’clock; and he was
sued by his landlord for rent; and he had a
yacht, “The Pear Tree,” which ran on trading
trips to Albany, and there were two or three
lawsuits in regard to that. He was also a
farmer of the excise on slaughtered cattle;
but, in spite of all his energy and variety of
employment, he died insolvent in 1664. The
last lawsuit in which Lawyer Solomon had
any share was through a posthumous connection,—the
burgher who furnished an anker
of French wine for the notary’s funeral
claimed a position as preferred creditor to
the estate.</p>

<p>A very aggravated case of scorn and resistance
of authority was that of Abel Hardenbrock
against the <i>schout</i> de Mill. And
this case shows equally the popular horror
of violations of the law and the confiding
trust of the justices that the word of the law
was enough without any visible restraining
force. Hardenbrock, who was a troublesome
fellow, had behaved most vilely, shoving the
<i>schout</i> on the breast, and wickedly “wishing
the devil might break his neck,” simply because
the <i>schout</i> went to Hardenbrock’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
house to warn his wife not to annoy further
Burgomaster De Peyster by unwelcome visits.
Hardenbrock was accordingly seized and
made a prisoner at the Stadt Huys “in the
chamber of Pieter Schaefbanck, where he
carried on and made a racket like one possessed
and mad, notwithstanding the efforts
of Heer Burgomaster Van Brught, running
up to the Court room and going away next
morning as if he had not been imprisoned.”
It was said with amusing simplicity that this
cool walking out of prison was “contrary to
the customs of the law,” and a fine of twenty-five
florins was imposed.</p>

<p>For serious words against the government,
which could be regarded as treasonable, the
decreed punishment was death. One Claerbout
van ter Goes used such words (unfortunately
they are not given in the indictment),
and a judgment was recorded from
each burgomaster and <i>schepen</i> as to what
punishment would be proper. He was
branded, whipped on a half-gallows, and
banished, and escaped hanging only by one
vote.</p>

<p>All classes in the community were parties
in these petty slander suits; schoolmasters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
and parsons appear to have been specially
active. Domine Bogardus and Domine
Schaets had many a slander suit. The most
famous and amusing of all these clerical suits
is the one brought by Domine Bogardus and
his wife, the posthumously famous Anneke
Jans, against Grietje von Salee, a woman of
very dingy reputation, who told in New Amsterdam
that the domine’s wife, Mistress
Anneke, had lifted her petticoats in unseemly
and extreme fashion when crossing a muddy
street. This was proved to be false, and the
evidence adduced was so destructive of
Grietje’s character that she stands disgraced
forever in history as the worst woman in
New Netherland.</p>

<p>Not only were slanderers punished, but
they were disgraced with terrible names. William
Bakker was called “a blasphemer, a
street schold, a murderer as far as his intentions
are concerned, a defamer, a disturber
of public peace,”—the concentration of
which must have made William Bakker hang
his head in the place of his banishment.
They were also rebuked from the pulpit, and
admonished in private.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best rebuke given, as well as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
unique one, was the one adopted by Domine
Frelinghuysen, who had suffered somewhat
from slander himself. He had this rhyme
painted in large letters on the back of his
sleigh, that he who followed might read:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Niemands tong; nog neimands pen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maakt my anders dan ik ben.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spreek quaad-spreekers: spreek vonder end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Niemand en word van u geschend.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which, translated into English, reads:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No one’s tongue, and no one’s pen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes me other than I am.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speak, evil-speakers, speak without end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No one heeds a word you say.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The original Court of the colony was composed
of a Director and his Council. In
1656, in answer to complaints from the colonists,
the States-General ordered the election
of a board of magistrates, in name and function
like those of the Fatherland; namely,
a <i>schout</i>, two burgomasters, and five <i>schepens</i>.
The duties of the burgomasters and <i>schepens</i>
were twofold: they regulated municipal affairs
like a board of aldermen, and they sat as
a court of justice both in civil and criminal
cases. The annual salary of a burgomaster
was fixed at one hundred and forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
dollars, and of a <i>schepen</i> at one hundred
dollars; but as these salaries were to come
out of the municipal chest, which was chronically
empty, they never were paid. When
funds did come in from the excise on taverns,
on slaughtered cattle, the tax on land, the
fees on transfers, etc., it always had to be
paid out in other ways,—for repairs for the
school-room, the <i>Graft</i>, the watch-room, the
Stadt Huys. It never entered the minds of
those guileless civic rulers, two centuries ago,
to pay themselves and let the other creditors
go without. The early city <i>schout</i> was also
<i>schout-fiskaal</i> till 1660; but the proper
duties of this functionary were really a combination
of those pertaining now to the
mayor, sheriff, and district-attorney. In the
little town one man could readily perform all
these duties. He also presided in Court. An
offender could thus be arrested, prosecuted,
and judged, by one and the same person,
which seems to us scarcely judicious; but
the bench of magistrates had one useful
power, that of mitigating and altering the
sentence demanded by the <i>schout</i>. Often a
fine of one hundred guilders would be reduced
to twenty-five; often the order for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
whipping would be set aside, and the command
of branding as well.</p>

<p>Sometimes justice in New York was tempered
with mercy, and sorely it needed it
when fierce English rule and law came in
force. Felons were few, but these few were
severely punished. A record of a trial in
1676 reveals a curious scene in Court, as well
as an astonishing celerity in the execution of
the law under English rule and in the English
army. Three soldiers stole a couple of iron
pots, two hoes, a pair of shears, and half a
firkin of soap. They were tried in the morning,
confessed, cast into “the Hole” in the
afternoon, and in the evening “the Governor
ordered some persons to go to the prisoners
and advise them to prepare for another world,
for that one of them should dye the next
day.” On the gloomy morrow, on Saturday,
the three terror-stricken souls drew lots, and
the fatal lot fell to one Thomas Weale. The
court of aldermen interceded for him and
finally secured his reprieve till Monday. The
peaceful Dutch Sunday, darkened and shocked
by this impending death, saw a strange and
touching sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the evening a company of the chiefe women
of the City, both English and Dutch, made earnest
suite to the Governor for the Condemned man’s
life. Monday in the morning the same women
who came the last night with many others of the
better sort, and a greater number of the ordinary
Dutch women, did again very much importune the
Governor to spare him.”</p>
</div>

<p>These tender-hearted colonists were indorsed
and supplemented by the petition of
Weale’s fellow-soldiers in the garrison, who
pleaded the prisoner’s youth and his past
usefulness, and who promised if he were
pardoned never to steal nor to conceal theft.
As a result of all this intercession, the Governor
“graciously” granted pardon.</p>

<p>This promise and pardon seem to have
accomplished much in army discipline, for
thereafter arrests for crime among the soldiery
were rare. Five years later a soldier was
accused of pilfering.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Court Marshall doth adjudge that the said
Melchoir Classen shall run the Gantlope once, the
length of the fort: where according to the custome
of that punishment, the souldiers shall have
switches delivered to them, with which they shall
strike him as he passes between them stript to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
waist, and at the Fort-gate the Marshall is to receive
him, and there to kick him out of the Garrison
as a cashiered person, when he is no more to
returne, and if any pay is due him it is to be
forfeited.”</p>
</div>

<p>And that was the end of Melchoir Classen.</p>

<p>Gantlope was the earlier and more correct
form of the word now commonly called gantlet.
Running the gantlope was a military
punishment in universal use.</p>

<p>Another common punishment for soldiers
(usually for rioting or drinking) was riding
the wooden horse. In New Amsterdam the
wooden horse stood between Paerel Street
and the Fort, and was twelve feet high. Garret
Segersen, for stealing chickens, rode the
wooden horse for three days from two o’clock
to close of parade with a fifty-pound weight
tied to each foot. At other times a musket
was tied to each foot of the disgraced man.
One culprit rode with an empty scabbard in
one hand and a pitcher in the other to show
his inordinate love for John Barleycorn. Jan
Alleman, a Dutch officer, challenged Jan de
Fries, who was <i>bedridden</i>; for this cruel and
meaningless insult he too rode the wooden
horse. In Revolutionary days we still find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
the soldiers of the Continental Army punished
by riding the wooden horse, or, as it
was sometimes called, “the timber mare;”
but it was probably a modification of the cruel
punishment of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>A sailor, for drawing a knife on a companion,
was dropped three times from the
yard-arm and received a kick from every
sailor on the ship,—a form of running the
gantlope. And we read of a woman who
enlisted as a seaman, and whose sex was
detected, being dropped three times from
the yard-arm and tarred and feathered.</p>

<p>These women petitioners for Soldier Weale
of whom I have told, were not the only
tender-hearted New Yorkers to petition for
“mercy, that herb of grace, to flower.”
During Stuyvesant’s rule his sister, Madam
Bayard, successfully interceded for the release,
and thereby saved the life, of an imprisoned
Quaker; and in September, 1713, two
counterfeiters were saved from the death penalty
by the intervention of New York dames.
We read, “Most of the gentlewomen of the
city waited on the Governor, and addressed
him earnestly with prayers and tears for the
lives of the culprits, who were accordingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
pardoned.” When two sailors rioted through
the town demanding food and drink, and used
Carel Van Brugh so roughly that his face was
cut, they were sentenced to be fastened to
the whipping-post, and scourged, and have
gashes cut in their faces; the wife of Van
Brugh and her friends petitioned that the
sentence should not be carried out, or at any
rate executed within a room. Doubtless other
examples could be found.</p>

<p>The laws of New Netherland were naturally
based upon the laws and customs of
the Fatherland, which in turn were formed
by the rules of the College of XIX. from
the Imperial Statutes of Charles V. and the
Roman civil law.</p>

<p>The punishments were the ordinary ones
of the times, neither more nor less severe than
those of the Fatherland or the other colonies.
In 1691 it was ordered that a ducking-stool
be erected in New York on the wharf
in front of the City Hall. The following
year an order was passed that a pillory, cage,
and ducking-stool be built. Though scolds
were punished, I have never seen any sentence
to show that this ducking-stool was
ever built, or that one was ever used in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
York; while instances of the use of a ducking-stool
are comparatively plentiful in the
Southern colonies. The ducking-stool was
an English “engine” of punishment, not a
Dutch.</p>

<p>The colonists were astonishingly honest.
Thieves were surprisingly few; they were
punished under Dutch rule by scourging with
rods, and usually by banishment,—a very
convenient way of shifting responsibility.
Assaults were punished by imprisonment and
subjection to prison fare, consisting only of
bread and water or <i>small beer</i>; and sometimes
temporary banishment. There was at
first no prison, so men were often imprisoned
in their own houses, which does not seem
very disgraceful. In the case of François de
Bruyn, tried for insulting and striking the
court messenger, he was fined two hundred
guilders, and answered that he would rot in
prison before he would pay. He was then
ordered to be imprisoned <i>in a respectable
tavern</i>, which sentence seems to have some
possibility of mitigating accompaniments.</p>

<p>In 1692 it was ordered in Kings County
that a good pair of stocks and a pound be
made in every bound within Kings County,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
and kept in sufficient repair. In repair and
in use were they kept till this century. Pillories
too were employed in punishment till
within the memory of persons now living.
The whipping-post was really a public blessing,—in
constant use, and apparently of constant
benefit, though the publicity of its employment
seems shocking to us to-day. The
public whipper received a large salary. In
1751, we learn from an advertisement, it was
twenty pounds annually.</p>

<p>Some of the punishments were really
almost picturesque in their ingenious inventions
of mortification and degradation. Truly
it was a striking sight when “Jan of Leyden”—a
foul-mouthed rogue, a true <i>blather-schuyten</i>—was
fastened to a stake in front of
the townhouse, with a bridle in his mouth
and a bundle of rods tied under each arm,
and a placard on his breast bearing the
inscription, “Lampoon-riter, false accuser,
defamer of magistrates.” Though he was
banished, I am sure he never was forgotten
by the children who saw him standing thus
garnished and branded on that spring day
in 1664. In the same place a thief was punished
by being forced to stand all day under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
a gallows, a gallows-rope around his neck and
empty sword-scabbard in his hand, a memorable
figure.</p>

<p>And could any who saw it ever forget the
punishment of Mesaack Martens, who stole
six cabbages from his neighbor, and confessed
and stood for days in the pillory with
cabbages on his head, that “the punishment
might fit the crime;” to us also memorable
because the prisoner was bootlessly <i>examined
by torture</i> to force confession of stealing fowls,
butter, turkeys, etc.</p>

<p>He was not the only poor creature who
suffered torture in New Amsterdam. It was
frequently threatened and several times executed.
The mate of a ship was accused of
assaulting a sheriff’s officer, who could not
identify positively his assailant. The poor
mate was put to torture, and <i>he was innocent</i>
of the offence. The assailant was proved to
be another man from whom the officer had
seized a keg of brandy. Still none in New
Amsterdam were tortured or pressed to
death. The blood of no Giles Corey stains
the honor of New Netherland.</p>

<p>Sometimes the execution of justice seemed
to “set a thief to catch a thief.” A letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
written by an English officer from Fort James
on Manhattan Island to Captain Silvester
Salisbury in Fort Albany in 1672 contains
this sentence:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had like to have lost our Hang-man Ben
Johnson, for he being taken in Divers Thefts and
Robbings convicted and found guilty, escaped his
neck through want of another Hangman to truss
him up, soe that all the punishment that he received
for his Three Years’ Roguery in thieving and stealing
(which was never found out till now) was only
39 stripes at the Whipping Post, loss of an Ear and
Banishment.”</p>
</div>

<p>We have the records of an attempt at capital
punishment in 1641; and Mr. Gerard’s account
of it in his paper “The Old Stadt-Huys” is
so graphic, I wish to give it in full:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The court proceedings before the Council,
urged by the Fiscal, were against Jan of Fort
Orange, Manuel Gerrit the Giant, Anthony Portugese,
Simon Congo, and five others, all negroes
belonging to the Company, for killing Jan Premero,
another negro. The prisoners having pleaded
guilty, and it being rather a costly operation to
hang nine able-bodied negroes belonging to the
Company, the sentence was that they were to draw
lots to determine ‘who should be punished with
the cord until death, praying the Almighty God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
the Creator of Heaven and Earth, to direct that the
lot may fall on the guiltiest, whereupon’ the record
reads, ‘the lot fell by God’s Providence on <i>Manuel
Gerrit, the Giant</i>, who was accordingly sentenced
to be hanged by the neck until dead as an example
to all such malefactors.’ Four days after the trial,
and on the day of the sentence, all <i>Nieuw Amsterdam</i>
left its accustomed work to gaze on the unwonted
spectacle. Various Indians also gathered,
wondering, to the scene. The giant negro is
brought out by the black hangman, and placed
on the ladder against the fort with two strong halters
around his neck. After an exhortation from
Domine Bogardus during which the negro chaunts
barbaric invocations to his favorite Fetich, he is
duly turned off the ladder into the air. Under the
violent struggles and weight of the giant, however,
both halters break. He falls to the ground. He
utters piteous cries. Now on his knees, now twisting
and groveling on the earth. The women shriek.
The men join in his prayers for mercy to the stern
Director. He is no trifler and the law must have
its course. The hangman prepares a stronger rope.
Finally the cry for mercy is so general that the Director
relents, and the fortunate giant is led off the
ground by his swarthy friends, somewhat disturbed
in his intellect by his near view of the grim King of
Terrors.”</p>
</div>

<p>Up to February 21, 1788, benefit of clergy
existed; that is, the plea in capital felonies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
being able to read. This was a monkish
privilege first extended only to priestly persons.
In England it was not abolished till
1827. The minutes of the Court of General
Quarter Sessions in New York bear records
of criminals who pleaded “the benefit” and
were branded on the brawn of the left
thumb with “T” in open court and then
discharged.</p>

<p>As the punishments accorded for crimes
were not severe for the notions of the times,
it is almost amusing to read some fierce
ordinances,—though there is no record of
any executions in accordance with them.
For instance, in January, 1659, by the
Director-General and Council with the advice
of the burgomasters and <i>schepens</i> it was
enacted that “No person shall strip the
fences of posts or rails under penalty for the
first offence of being whipped and branded,
and for the second, of punishment with the
cord until death ensues.” It is really astonishing
to think of these kindly Dutch
gentlemen calmly ordering hanging for stealing
fence-rails, though of course the matter
reached further than at first appeared: there
was danger of a scarcity of grain; and if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
fences were stolen, the cattle would trample
down and destroy the grain. Later orders as
to fences were given which appear eminently
calculated to be mischief-making. “Persons
thinking their neighbors’ fences not good,
first to request them to repair; failing which
to report to the overseers.” In 1674 all
persons were forbidden to leave the city
except by city-gate, under penalty of death;
this was of course when war threatened.</p>

<p>The crime of suicide was not without
punishment. Suicides were denied ordinary
burial rites. In Dutch days when one Smitt
of New York committed suicide, the <i>schout</i>
asked that his body be drawn on a hurdle
and buried with a stake in his heart. This
order was not executed; he was buried at
night and his estates confiscated. When Sir
Danvers Osborne—the Governor for a day—was
found dead by his own act, he was
“decently interred in Trinity churchyard.”</p>

<p>Women in New York sometimes made
their appearance in New York courts, as in
those of other colonies, in another rôle than
that of witness or criminal; they sometimes
sat on juries. In the year 1701, six good
Albany wives served on a jury: Tryntje<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
Roseboom, Catheren Gysbertse, Angeneutt
Jacobse, Marritje Dirkse, Elsje Lansing, and
Susanna Bratt. They were, of course, empanelled
for a special duty, not to serve on
the entire evidence of the case for which they
were engaged.</p>

<p>Many old records are found which employ
quaint metaphors or legal expressions; I
give one which refers to a custom which
seems at one time to have been literally
performed. It occurs in a commission
granted to the trustees of an estate of which
the debts exceeded the assets. Any widow
in Holland or New Netherland could be relieved
of all demands or claims of her husband’s
creditors by relinquishing all right
of inheritance. This widow took this privilege;
it is recorded thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Whereas</i>, Harman Jacobsen Bamboes has been
lately shot dead, murdered by the Indians, and
whereas the estate left by him <i>has been kicked
away with the foot by his wife who has laid the
key on the coffin</i>, it is therefore necessary to authorize
and qualify some persons to regulate the
same.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was a well-known Dutch saying
which referred to this privilege, <i>Den Sleutel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
op het graf leggen</i>, and simply meant not to
pay the debts of the deceased.</p>

<p>This legal term and custom is of ancient
origin. In Davies’ “History of Holland” we
read of a similar form being gone through
with in Holland in 1404, according to the
law of Rhynland. The widow of a great
nobleman immediately after his death desired
to renounce all claim on his estate and
responsibility for his debts. She chose a
guardian, and, advancing with him to the
door of the Court (where the body of the
dead Count had been placed on a bier), announced
that she was dressed wholly in
borrowed clothing; she then formally gave
a straw to her guardian, who threw it on the
dead body, saying he renounced for her all
right of dower, and abjured all debts. This
was derived from a still more ancient custom of
the Franks, who renounced all alliances by the
symbolic breaking and throwing away a straw.</p>

<p>In other states of the Netherlands the
widow gave up dower and debts by laying a
key and purse on the coffin. This immunity
was claimed by persons in high rank, one being
the widow of the Count of Flanders.</p>

<p>In New England (as I have told at length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
in my book, “Customs and Fashions in Old
New England,”) the widow who wished to
renounce her husband’s debts was married
in her shift, often at the cross-roads, at midnight.
These shift-marriages took place in
Massachusetts as late as 1836; I have a copy
of a court record of that date.</p>

<p>I know of but one instance of the odious
and degrading English custom of wife-trading
taking place in New York. Laurens Duyts,
an agent for Anneke Jans in some of her
business transactions, was in the year 1663
sentenced to be flogged and have his right
ear cut off for selling his wife, Mistress Duyts,
to one Jansen. Possibly the severity of the
punishment may have prevented the recurrence
of the crime.</p>

<p>After a somewhat extended study and comparison
of the early court and church records
of New England with those of New York, I
cannot fail to draw the conclusion—if it is
just to judge from such comparisons—that
the state of social morals was higher in the
Dutch colonies than in the English. Perhaps
the settlers of Boston and Plymouth were
more severe towards suspicion of immorality,
as they were infinitely more severe towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
suspicion of irreligion, than were their Dutch
neighbors. And they may have given more
publicity and punishment to deviations from
the path of rectitude and uprightness; but
certainly from their own records no fair-minded
person can fail to deem them more
frail, more erring, more wicked, than the
Dutch. The circumstances of immigration
and the tendencies of temperament were diverse,
and perhaps it was natural that a reaction
tending to sin and vice should come
to the intense and overwrought religionist
rather than to the phlegmatic and prosperous
trader. In Virginia and Maryland the
presence of many convict-emigrants would
form a reasonable basis for the existence of
the crime and law-breaking which certainly
was in those colonies far in excess of the
crime in New Netherland and New York.</p>

<p>I know that Rev. Mr. Miller, the English
clergyman, did not give the settlement a very
good name at the last of the seventeenth century;
but even his strictures cannot force me
to believe the colonists so unbearably wicked.</p>

<p>It should also be emphasized that New
Netherland was far more tolerant, more generous
than New England to all of differing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
religious faiths. Under Stuyvesant, however,
Quakers were interdicted from preaching,
were banished, and one Friend was treated
with great cruelty. The Dutch clergymen
opposed the establishment of a Lutheran
church, and were rebuked by the Directors
in Holland, who said that in the future they
would send out clergymen “not tainted with
any needless preciseness;” and Stuyvesant
was also rebuked for issuing an ordinance
imposing a penalty for holding conventicles
not in accordance with the Synod of Dort.
Many Christians not in accordance in belief
with that synod settled in New Netherland.
Quakers, Lutherans, Church of England folk,
Anabaptists, Huguenots, Waldenses, Walloons.
The Jews were protected and admitted
to the rights of citizenship. Director
Kieft, with heavy ransoms, rescued the captive
Jesuits, Father Jogues and Father Bressani,
from the Indians and tenderly cared for
them. No witches suffered death in New
York, and no statute law existed against
witchcraft. There is record of but one
witchcraft trial under the English governor,
Nicholls, who speedily joined with the Dutch
in setting aside all that nonsense.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br><span class="small">CHURCH AND SUNDAY IN OLD NEW YORK</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Sunday was not observed in New Netherland
with any such rigidity as in New England.
The followers of Cocceius would not
willingly include Saturday night, and not
even all of the Sabbath day, in their holy
time. Madam Knight, writing in 1704 of a
visit to New York, noted: “The Dutch aren’t
strict in keeping the Sabbath as in Boston
and other places where I have been.” This
was, of course, in times of English rule in
New York. Still, much respect to the day
was required, especially under the governing
hand of the rigid Calvinist Stuyvesant. He
specially enjoined and enforced strict regard
for seemly quiet during service time. The
records of Stuyvesant’s government are full
of injunctions and laws prohibiting “tavern-tapping”
during the hours of church service.
He would not tolerate fishing, gathering of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
berries or nuts, playing in the street, nor
gaming at ball or bowls during church time.
At a little later date the time of prohibition
of noise and tapping and gaming was extended
to include the entire Sabbath day,
and the <i>schout</i> was ordered to be active in
searching out and punishing such offenders.</p>

<p>Occasionally his vigilance did discover
some Sabbath disorders. He found the
first Jew trader who came to the island of
Manhattan serenely keeping open shop on
Sunday, and selling during sermon time,
knowing naught of any Sunday laws of New
Amsterdam.</p>

<p>And Albert the Trumpeter was seen on the
Sabbath in suspicious guise, with an axe on
his shoulder,—but he was only going to cut
a bat for his little son; and as for his neighbor
who did cut wood, it was only kindling,
since his children were cold.</p>

<p>And one Sunday evening in 1660 the <i>schout</i>
triumphantly found three sailors round a tap-house
table with a lighted candle and a
backgammon-board thereon; and he surely
had a right to draw an inference of gaming
therefrom.</p>

<p>And in another public-house ninepins were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
visible, and a can and glass, during preaching-time.
The landlady had <i>her</i> excuse,—some
came to her house and said church was out,
and one chanced to have a bowl in his hand
and another a pin, but there was no playing
at bowls.</p>

<p>Still, though he snooped and fined, in 1656
the burgomasters learned “by daily and painful
experience” that the profanation of “the
Lord’s day of Rest by the dangerous, Yes,
damnable Sale or Dealing out of Wines Beers
and Brandy-Waters” still went on; and fresh
Sunday Laws were issued forbidding “the
ordinary and customary Labors of callings,
such as Sowing, Mowing, Building, Sawing
wood, Smithing, Bleeching, Hunting, Fishing.”
All idle sports were banned and
named: “Dancing, Card-playing, Tick-tacking,
Playing at ball, at bowls, at ninepins;
taking Jaunts in Boats, Wagons, or Carriages.”</p>

<p>In 1673, again, the magistrates “experienced
to our great grief” that rolling ninepins
was more in vogue on Sunday than on
any other day. And we learn that there were
social clubs that “Set on the Sabbath,”
which must speedily be put an end to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
Thirty men were found by the <i>schout</i> in one
<i>tap-huys</i>; but as they were playing ninepins
and backgammon two hours after the
church-doors had closed, prosecution was
most reluctantly abandoned.</p>

<p>Of course scores of “tappers” were prosecuted,
both in taverns and private houses.
Piety and regard for an orderly Sabbath were
not the only guiding thoughts in the burgomasters’
minds in framing these Sunday
liquor laws and enforcing them; for some
tapsters had “tapped beer during divine service
and used a small kind of measure which
is in contempt of our religion and must ruin
our state,”—and the state was sacred. In
the country, as for instance on Long Island,
the carting of grain, travelling for pleasure,
and shooting of wild-fowl on Sunday were
duly punished in the local courts.</p>

<p>I do not think that children were as rigid
church attendants in New York as in New
England. In 1696, in Albany, we find this
injunction: “y<sup>e</sup> Constables in eache warde
to take thought in attending at y<sup>e</sup> church to
hender such children as Profane y<sup>e</sup> Sabbath;”
and we know that Albany boys and girls
were complained of for coasting down hill on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
Sunday,—which enormity would have been
simply impossible in New England, except
in an isolated outburst of Adamic depravity.
In another New York town the “Athoatys”
complained of the violation of the Sabbath
by “the Younger Sort of people in Discourssing
of Vane things and Running of Raesses.”
As for the city of New York, even at Revolutionary
times a cage was set up on City
Hall Park in which to confine wicked New
York boys who profaned the Sabbath. I do
not find so full provisions made for seating
children in Dutch Reformed churches as in
Puritan meeting-houses. A wise saying of
Martin Luther’s was “Public sermons do
very little edify children”—perhaps the
Dutch agreed with him. As the children
were taught the Bible and the catechism
every day in the week, their spiritual and
religious schooling was sufficient without
the Sunday sermon,—but, of course, if they
were not in the church during services, they
would “talk of vane Things and run Raesses.”</p>

<p>Before the arrival of any Dutch preacher in
the new settlement in the new world, the spiritual
care of the little company was provided
for by men appointed to a benign and beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
old Dutch office, and called <i>krankebesoeckers</i>
or <i>zeikentroosters</i>,—“comforters of the
Sick,”—who not only tenderly comforted
the sick and weary of heart, but “read to the
Commonalty on Sundays from texts of Scripture
with the Comments.” These pious men
were assigned to this godly work in Fort
Orange and in New Amsterdam and Breuckelen.
In Esopus they had meetings every
Sunday, “and one among us read something
for a postille.” Often special books of
sermons were read to the congregations.</p>

<p>In Fort Orange they had a domine before
they had a church. The patroon instructed
Van Curler to build a church in 1642; but it
was not until 1646 that the little wooden
edifice was really put up. It was furnished
at a cost of about thirty-two dollars by carpenter
Fredricksen, with a <i>predickstoel</i>, or
pulpit, a seat for the magistrates,—<i>de Heerebanke</i>,—one
for the deacons, nine benches
and several corner-seats.</p>

<p>The first church at Albany, built in 1657,
was simply a block house with loop-holes for
the convenient use of guns in defence against
the Indians,—if defence were needed. On
the roof were placed three small cannon commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
the three roads which led to it.
This edifice was called “a handsome preaching-house,”
and its congregation boasted that
it was almost as large as the fine new one
in New Amsterdam. Its corner-stone was
laid with much ceremony. In its belfry hung
a bell presented to the little congregation by
the Directors of the Amsterdam Chamber of
the West India Company. The <i>predickstoel</i>
was the gift of the same board of West India
Directors, since the twenty-five beavers’ skins
sent for its purchase proved greatly damaged,
and hence inadequate as payment.</p>

<p>This pulpit still exists,—a pedestal with a
flight of narrow steps and curved balustrade.
It is about four feet in height to its floor, and
only three in diameter. It is octagonal; one
of the sides is hinged, and forms the entrance
door or gate. All the small trimmings and
mouldings are of oak, and it has a small
bracket or frame to hold the hour-glass. It
stood in a space at the end of the centre
aisle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>
<p>From the ceiling hung a chandelier, and
candle-sconces projected from the walls.
There were originally two low-set galleries;
a third was added in 1682. The men sat in
the galleries, and as they carried their arms
to meeting, were thus conveniently placed to
fire through the loop-holes if necessity arose.
The bell-rope from the belfry hung down in
the middle of the church, and when not in
use was twisted round a post set for the
purpose.</p>

<p>This church was plain enough, but it was
certainly kept in true Dutch cleanliness, for
house-cleaners frequently invaded it with pails
and scrubbing-brushes, brooms, lime, and
sand. Even the chandelier was scoured, and a
<i>ragebol</i>, or cobweb-brush, was purchased by
the deacon for the use of the scrubbers. The
floor was sanded with fine beach-sand, as were
the floors of dwelling-houses. I find in the
records of the Long Island churches frequent
entries of payments for church brooms and
church sand,—in Jamaica as late a date as
1836. In 1841 the deacons bought a carpet.</p>

<p>In 1715 the second Albany church was
built, on the site of the old one. As Pepys
tells of St. Paul’s of London, so tradition says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
this Albany church was built around the first
one, that the congregation were only three
weeks deprived of the use of the church, and
the old one was carried out “by piece meal.”
At any rate, it was precisely similar in shape,
but was a substantial edifice of stone. This
building was not demolished until 1806.</p>

<p>The sittings in this church sold for thirty
shillings each, and were, as it was termed,
“booked to next of kin.” When the first
owner of a seat died (were he a man), the
seat descended to his son or the eldest of his
grandsons; if there was no son nor grandson,
to his son-in-law; this heir being in default,
the sitting fell to a brother, and so on.
When the transfer was made, the successor
paid fifteen shillings to the church. A
woman’s seat descended to her daughter,
daughter-in-law, or sister. Sittings were sold
only to persons residing in Albany County.
When a seat was not claimed by any heir of
a former owner, it reverted to the church.</p>

<p>This church had some pretence to ornamentation.
The windows were of stained glass
decorated with the coat-of-arms of various
Albany families. The panes with the Van
Renssellaer and Dudley arms are still in existence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
Painted escutcheons also hung on
the walls, as they did in the church in Garden
Street, New York. This was a custom of
the Fatherland. A writer of that day said
of the church in Harlem, “It is battered as
full of scutcheons as the walls can hold.”</p>

<p>The meeting-house sometimes bore other
decorations,—often “Billets of sales,” and
notices of vendues or “outcrys.” Lost
swine and empounded swine were signified
by placards; town meetings and laws were
posted. In the Albany church, when there
was rumor of an approaching war with
France, “powder, bales,” and guns to the
number of fifty were ordered to be “hung up
in y<sup>e</sup> church,”—a stern reminder of possible
sudden bloodshed. “Y<sup>e</sup> fyre-masters” were
also ordered to see that “y<sup>e</sup> fyre-ladders and
fyre-hooks were hung at y<sup>e</sup> church.”</p>

<p>In 1698 a stone church was built in Flatbush.
It cost nearly sixteen thousand guilders.
It had a steep four-sided roof, ending
in the centre in a small steeple. This roof
was badly constructed, for it pressed out the
upper part of one wall more than a foot over
the foundation, and sorely bent the braces.
The pulpit faced the door, and was flanked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
by the deacons’ bench on one side and the
elders’ bench on the other.</p>

<p>Of the seating arrangement of this Flatbush
church Dr. Strong says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The male part of the congregation were seated
in a continuous pew all along the wall, divided into
twenty apartments, with a sufficient number of doors
for entrance, each person having one or more seats.
The residue of the interior of the building was for
the accommodation of the female part of the congregation,
who were seated on chairs. These were
arranged into seven rows or blocks, and every
family had one or more chairs in some one of
these blocks. This arrangement of seats was called
‘De Gestoeltens.’ Each chair was marked on the
back by a number or by the name of the person to
whom it belonged.”</p>
</div>

<p>When the church was remodelled, in
1774, there were two galleries, one for white
folk, one for black; the benches directly
under the galleries were free. In the centre
of the main floor were two benches
with backs, one called the Yefrows Bench,
the other the Blue Bench. The former was
for the minister’s wife and family; the other
was let out to individuals, and was a seat of
considerable dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Many of the old Dutch churches, especially
those on Long Island, were six-sided or
eight-sided; these had always a high, steep,
pyramidal roof terminating in a belfry, which
was often topped by a gilded <i>weerhaen</i>, or
weathercock. The churches at Jamaica and
New Utrecht were octagonal. The Bushwick
church was hexagonal. It stood till
1827,—a little, dingy, rustic edifice. This
form of architecture was not peculiar to the
Dutch nor to the Dutch Reformed Church.
Episcopal churches and the Quaker meeting-house
at Flushing were similar in shape.</p>

<p>When the bold sea-captain De Vries, that
interesting figure in the early history of New
Netherland, arrived in churchless New Amsterdam,
he promptly rallied Director Kieft
on his dilatoriness and ungodliness, saying it
was a shame to let Englishmen see the mean
barn which served Manhattan as a church;
and he drew odious comparisons,—that “the
first thing they build in New England after
their dwelling-houses is a fine church.” He
pointed out the abundant materials for building
creditably and cheaply,—fine oak wood,
good mountain stone, excellent lime; and he
did more,—he supported his advice by a subscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
of a hundred guilders. Director
Kieft promised a thousand guilders from the
West India Company; and Fortune favored
the scheme, for the daughter of Domine
Bogardus was married opportunely just at that
time; and as has been told in Chapter III.,
according to the wise custom of the day
in Holland, and consequently in America, a
collection was taken up at the wedding.
Kieft asked that it be employed for the building
of a church; and soon a stone church
seventy-two feet long and fifty-five feet wide
was erected within the Fort. It was the
finest building in New Netherland, and bore
on its face a stone inscribed with these words:
“Anno Domini 1641, William Kieft, Director-General,
hath the Commonalty built this
Temple.” It was used by the congregation
as a church for fifty years, and for half a century
longer by the military as a post-building,
when it was burned.</p>

<p>There was no church in Breuckelen in
1660. Domine Selyns wrote, “We preach
in a barn.” The church was built six years
later, and is described as square, with thick
stone walls and steep peaked roof surmounted
by a small open belfry, in which hung the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
small, sharp-toned bell which had been sent
over as a gift by the West India Company.
The walls were so panelled with dark wood,
the windows were so high and narrow, that
it was always dark and gloomy within; even
in summer-time it was impossible to see to
read in it after four o’clock in the afternoon.
Services were held in summer at 9 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> and
2 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, and in the winter in the morning
only. The windows were eight feet from the
floor, and were darkened with stained glass
sent from Holland, representing flower-pots
with vines covered with vari-colored flowers.
This church stood in the middle of the road
on what is now Fulton Street, a mile from
the ferry, and was used until 1810.</p>

<p>These early churches were unheated, and
it is told that the half-frozen domines
preached with heavy knit or fur caps pulled
over their ears, and wearing mittens, or <i>wollen
handt-schoenen</i>; and that <i>myn heer</i> as well
as <i>myn vrouw</i> carried muffs. It is easy to
fancy some men carrying muffs,—some love-locked
Cavalier or mincing Horace Walpole;
but such feminine gear seems to consort ill
with an Albany Dutchman. That he should
light his long pipe in meeting was natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
enough,—to keep warm; though folk do say
that he smoked in meeting in summer too,—to
keep cool. By the middle of the eighteenth
century the Albany and Schenectady
churches had stoves perched up on pillars on
a level with the gallery,—in high disregard
or ignorance of the laws of calorics; hence,
of course, the galleries, in which sat the men,
were fairly heated, while the ground floor
and the <i>vrouws</i> remained below in icy frigidity.
It is told of more than one old-time
sexton, that he loudly asserted his office
and his importance by noisy rattling-down
and replenishing of the gallery stoves and
slamming of the iron doors at the most critical
point in the domine’s sermon. Cornelius
Van Schaick, the Albany sexton, made his
triumphant way to the stoves, slashing with
his switch (perhaps his dog-whip) all the
boys who chanced to be in his way.</p>

<p>The women of the congregation carried
foot-stoves of perforated metal or wood, which
were filled with a box of living coals, to
afford a little warmth to the feet. Many now
living remember the scratching sound of
these stoves on the boards or the sanded floor
as they were passed from warm feet to cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
feet near at hand. <i>Kerck-stooven</i> appear on
the earliest inventories, were used in America
until our own day, and still are used in
the churches in Holland. In an anteroom in
a Leyden church may be seen several hundred
<i>stooven</i> for use in the winter.</p>

<p>It is stated of the churches in New York
City that until 1802 services were held, even
in the winter-time, with wide-open doors,
and that often the snow lay in little drifts
up the aisles,—which may have been one
reason why young folk flocked to Trinity
Church.</p>

<p>One very handsome church-equipment of
the women attendants of the Dutch Reformed
church was the Psalm-book. This was usually
bound with the New Testament; and both
were often mounted and clasped with silver.
Sometimes they had two silver rings at the
back through which ribbons could be passed,
to hang thereby the books on the back of a
chair if desired. Sometimes the books had
silver chains. Rarely they were mounted in
gold. The inventory of the estate of nearly
every well-to-do Dutch woman, resident of
New York, Albany, or the larger towns,
shows one, and sometimes half-a-dozen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
these silver-mounted Psalm-books. Elizabeth
Van Es had two Bibles with silver
clasps, two Psalm-books, and two Catechisms.
These books were somewhat dingily printed,
in old Dutch, on coarse but durable paper;
the music was on every page beside the words.
The notes of music were square, heavily
printed, rough-hewn, angular notes,—“like
stones in the walls of a churchyard,” says
Longfellow of the Psalm-book of the Pilgrims.
The metrical version of the Psalms
was simple and impressive, and is certainly
better literary work in Dutch than is the Bay
Psalm-book in English.</p>

<p>The services in these churches were long.
They were opened by reading and singing
conducted by the <i>voorleezer</i> or <i>voorzanger</i>,—that
general-utility man who was usually precentor,
schoolmaster, bell-ringer, sexton,
grave-digger, and often town-clerk. As
ordered by the Assembly of XIX., in 1645,
he “tuned the psalm;” and during the first
singing the domine entered, and, pausing for
a few moments, sometimes kneeling at the
foot of the pulpit-stairs, in silent prayer, he
soon ascended to his platform of state. The
psalms were given out to the congregation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
through the medium of a large hanging-board
with movable printed slips, and this was in
the charge of the <i>voorleezer</i>. Of course the
powers of this church functionary varied in
different towns. In all he seems to have had
charge of the turning of the hour-glass which
stood near the pulpit in sight of the domine.
In Kingston, where the pulpit was high, he
thrust up to the preacher the notices stuck in
the end of a cleft stick. In this town, at the
time of the Revolution, he was also paid two
shillings per annum by each family to go
around and knock loudly on the door each
Sunday morning to warn that it was service-time.
In some towns he was permitted to
give three sharp raps of warning with his staff
on the pulpit when the hour-glass had run out
a second time,—thus shutting off the sermon.
The <i>voorleezer</i> is scarcely an obsolete church-officer
to-day. In 1865 died the last Albany
<i>voorleezer</i>, and the Flatbush <i>voorleezer</i> is well
remembered and beloved.</p>

<p>The clerk in New Amsterdam was a
marked personage on Sunday. After he had
summoned the congregation by the sound
of drum or bell, he ceremoniously formed
a pompous little procession of his underlings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
and, heading the line, he carried
with their assistance the cushions from the
City Hall to the church, to furnish comfortably
the “Magistrate’s Pew,” in which the
burgomasters and <i>schepens</i> sat.</p>

<p>The deacons had full control of all the
funds of the church; they collected the contributions
of the congregation by walking up
and down the aisles and thrusting in front of
each “range” of seats in the face of the
seated people small cloth contribution-bags,
or <i>sacjes</i>, hung on a hoop at the end of a
slender pole six or eight feet in length,—fashioned,
in fact, somewhat after the model
of scoop-nets. This custom—the use of so
unfamiliar a medium for church-collecting—gave
rise to the amusing notion of one
observant English traveller that Dutch deacons
passed round their old hats on the end
of a walking-stick to gather church-contributions.</p>

<p>Often a little bell hung at the bottom of
the contribution-bag, or was concealed in an
ornamenting tassel, and by its suggestive
tinkle-tinkle warned all church-attendants
of the approach of the deacon, and perhaps
aroused the peaceful church-sleepers from too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
selfish dreams of profitable barter in peltries.
In New Utrecht the church <i>sacje</i> had an
alarm-bell which sounded only when a contribution
was made. A loud-speaking silence
betrayed the stingy church-goer. The collection
was usually taken up in the middle
of a sermon. The <i>sacjes</i> stood or hung conveniently
in the deacon’s seat. In Flatbush
and other towns the deacons paused for a
time in front of the pulpit—<i>sacje</i> in hand—while
the domine enjoined generosity to the
church and kindly Christian thought of the
poor. The collection-bags in Flatbush were
of velvet.</p>

<p>It is said that stray Indians who chanced
to wander or were piously persuaded to enter
into the Fort Orange or Albany church during
service-time, and who did not well understand
the pulpit eloquence of the Dutch
tongue, regarded with suspicious and disapproving
eyes the unfailing and unreasonable
appearance of the <i>karck-sacje</i>; for they
plainly perceived that there was some occult
law of cause and effect which could be deduced
from these two facts,—the traders who
gave freely into the church-bags on Sunday always
beat down the price of beaver on Monday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>The bill for one of these <i>karck-sacjes</i> was
paid by the deacons of the Albany church in
1682. Seven guilders were given for the
black stuff and two skeins of silk, and two
guilders for the making. When a ring was
bought for the sack (I suppose to hold it
open at the top), it cost four guilders. This
instrument of church-collection lingered long
in isolated localities. It is vaguely related
that some <i>karck-sacjes</i> are still in existence
and still used. The church at New Utrecht
possessed and exhibited theirs at their bicentennial
celebration a few years ago. The
fate of the <i>sacje</i> was decreed when the honest
deacons were forced to conclude that it could,
if artfully manipulated by designing moderns,
conceal far too well the amount given by
each contributor, and equally well concealed
the many and heavy stones deposited therein
by vain youth of Dutch descent but American
ungodliness. So an open-faced full-in-view
pewter or silver plate was substituted and
passed in its place. In 1813 the church at
Success, Long Island, bought contribution
plates and abandoned the <i>sacje</i>. Some lovers
of the good old times resented this inevitable
exposure of the amount of each gift, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
turned away from the deacon and his innovating
fashion and refused to give at all.</p>

<p>I ought to add, in defence of the <i>karck-sacjes</i>,
and in praise of the early congregations,
that the amount gathered each week
was most generous, and in proportion far in
advance of our modern church-contributions.
The poor were not taken charge of by state
or town, but were liberally cared for in each
community by its church; occasionally, however,
assistance was given through the assignment
to the church by the courts of a portion
of the money paid as fines in civil and criminal
cases. In New York a deacon’s house
with nurses resident, took the place of an
almshouse.</p>

<p>Often during the year much more money
was collected than was needful for the current
expenses of the church. In Albany
the extra collections were lent out at eight
per cent interest; at one time four thousand
guilders were lent to one man. The deacons
who took charge of the treasury chest in
Albany each year rendered an account of its
contents. In 1665 there were in this chest
<i>seelver-gelt</i>, <i>sea-want</i>, and <i>obligasse</i>, or obligations,
to the amount of 2829 guilders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
In 1667 there were 3299 guilders; also good
Friesland stockings and many ells of linen
to be given to the poor.</p>

<p>In some churches poor-boxes were placed at
the door. The Garden Street Church in New
York had two strong boxes bound with iron,
with a small hole in the padlocked lid, and
painted with the figure of a beggar leaning
on a staff,—which, according to the testimony
of travellers, was a sight unknown in
reality in New York at that time.</p>

<p>The “church-poor,” as they were called,
fared well in New Netherland. Of degraded
poor of Dutch birth or descent there were
none. Some poor folk, and old or sickly,
having a little property, transferred it to the
Consistory, who paid it out as long as it
lasted, and cheerfully added to the amount
by gifts from the church-treasury as long
as was necessary for the support of those
“of the poorer sort.” To show that these
church-poor were neither neglected nor despised,
let me give one example of a case—an
ordinary one—from the deacons’ records
of the Albany church in 1695. Claes
Janse was assigned at that time to live
with Hans Kros and his wife Antje. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
were to provide him with <i>logement</i>, <i>kost</i>,
<i>drank</i>, <i>wassen</i> (lodging, food, drink, and washing),
and for this were paid forty guilders a
month by the church. When Claes died,
the church paid for his funeral, which apparently
left nothing undone in the way of respectability.
The bill reads thus:—</p>

<p>With a good dry coffin, a good dry grave,
and a far from dry funeral, Hans Claes’
days, though he were of the church-poor,
ended in honor.</p>

<p>The earlier Dutch ministers were some
of them rather rough characters. Domine
Bogardus, in New Amsterdam, and Domine
Schaets, in Fort Orange, were most unclerical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
in demeanor, both in and out of the
pulpit. Both were engaged in slander suits,
the former as libeller and defendant; both
were abusive and personal in the pulpit,
“dishonoring the church by passion.” The
former was alleged by his enemies to be frequently
drunk, in church and abroad; and,
fearless of authority, he seized the pulpit as
a convenient and prominent platform from
which he could denounce his opposers. From
his high post he scolded the magistrates,
called opprobrious names (a hateful offence
in New Amsterdam), threatened Wouter
Van Twiller that he would give “from the
pulpit such a shake as would make him
shudder.” He even arbitrarily refused the
Communion, thereby causing constant scandal
and dissension. The magistrates doubtless
deserved all his rebukes, but in their
written admonition to him they appear with
some dignity, expressing themselves forcibly
and concisely thus: “Your bad tongue is the
cause of these divisions, and your obstinacy
the cause of their continuance;” and it is
difficult now to assign the blame and odium
of this quarrel very decidedly to either party.</p>

<p>The domine did not have everything his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
own way on Sundays, for the Director drowned
his vociferations by ordering the beating of
drums and firing of cannon outside the church
during services; and denounced the sermons
in picturesque language as “the rattling of
old wives’ stories drawn out from a distaff.”</p>

<p>The Labadist travellers thus described the
Albany domine:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We went to church in the morning [April 28,
1680], and heard Domine Schaets preach, who,
although he is a poor old ignorant person, and besides
is not of good life, yet had to give utterance
to his passion, having for his text ‘Whatever is
taken upon us,’ etc., at which many of his auditors,
who knew us better, were not well pleased, and in
order to show their condemnation of it, laughed
and derided him, which we corrected.”</p>
</div>

<p>In turn the Lutheran minister was dubbed
by the Dutch domines “a rolling, rollicking,
unseemly carl, more inclined to pore over
the wine-kan than to look into the Bible.”
And we all know what both Lutherans and
Dutch thought of the Quaker preachers; so
all denominations appear equally rude.</p>

<p>The salaries of the ministers were liberal
even in early days; that of Domine Megapolensis
(the second minister sent to New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
Netherland) was, I think, a very fair one.
He agreed to remain in the colony six years,
and was given free passage for himself and
family to the new world; an outfit of three
hundred guilders; a salary of three hundred
guilders a year for three years, and five hundred
annually during the three remaining
years; and an annual tithe of thirty schepels
of wheat and two firkins of butter. If he
died before the term expired, his wife was to
have a pension of a hundred guilders a year
for the unexpired term. The first revenue
relinquished by the West India Company to
the town of New Amsterdam was the “tapster’s
excise,”—the excise on wine, beer, and
spirits,—and the sole condition made by
Stuyvesant on its surrender, as to its application,
was that the salaries of the two domines
should be paid from it.</p>

<p>As time passed on, firewood became one
of the minister’s perquisites, in addition to
his salary, sixty or seventy loads a season.
We find the Schenectady congregation having
a “bee” to gather in the domine’s wood;
and the Consistory supplied plentiful wine,
rum, and beer as a treat for the “bee.”</p>

<p>What Cotton Mather called the “angelical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
conjunction” of piety and physic sometimes
was found in the person of the ministers of
the Dutch Reformed church, but not so
constantly as among the Puritan ministers.
Domine Rubel, sent out by the Classis of
Amsterdam, was settled over the churches
in Kings County. He was more devoted to
the preparation of quack medicines than to
the saving of souls. One of his advertisements
of March 28, 1778, reads thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has pleased Almighty God to give me the

<span class="smcap">Johannes Casparus Rubel</span>, Minister of the<br>
<span style="margin-right: 14em;">Gospel and Chymicus.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>This does not let us wonder that after a
while his parish became dissatisfied with
his ministrations, and that he ended his
days in dishonor.</p>

<p>The employment of the Dutch language
in the pulpit in New York churches lasted
until into this century. Naturally, Dutch
was used as long as the Classis at Amsterdam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
supplied the churches in America with
preachers. In 1744 Domine Rubel and
Domine Van Sinderin were sent to Flatbush,
the last ministers sent from the Classis
of Amsterdam to any American church;
but at their death the Dutch tongue was not
silent in the Flatbush church; for their
successor, Domine Schoonmaker, lived to
be ninety years old, and never preached but
one sermon in English. With his death, in
1824, ceased the public use of the Dutch
language in the Flatbush pulpit. Until the
year 1792 the entire service in his church
was “the gospel undefiled, in Holland Dutch.”
Until the year 1830 services in the sequestered
churches in the Catskills were held
alternately in Dutch and English. Until
1777 all the records of the Sleepy Hollow
church were kept in Dutch; and in 1785 all
its services were in Dutch. In September
of that year, a little child, Lovine Hauws,
was baptized in English by the new minister,
Rev. Stephen Van Voorhees. This raised a
small Dutch tempest, and the new domine
soon left that parish.</p>

<p>In New York City the large English immigration,
the constant requirements and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
influences of commerce, and the frequent
intermarriages of the English and Dutch
robbed the Dutch language of its predominance
by the middle of the eighteenth century.
Rev. Dr. Laidlie preached in 1764
the first English sermon to a Dutch Reformed
congregation. By 1773 English was used
in the Dutch school, and young people began
to shun the Dutch services.</p>

<p>The growth of the Dutch Reformed church
in New York was slow; this was owing to
three marked and direct causes:—</p>

<p>First, from 1693 until Revolutionary times
Episcopacy was virtually established by law
in a large part of the province,—in the city
and county of New York, and in the counties
of Westchester, Richmond, and Queens; and
though the Dutch Reformed church was
protected and respected, people of all denominations
were obliged to contribute to
the support of the Episcopal church.</p>

<p>Second, the English language had become
the current language of the province; in the
schools, the courts, in all public business it
was the prevailing tongue, while the services
of the Dutch Reformed church were by preference
held in Dutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>Third, all candidates for ministry in the
Dutch Reformed church were obliged to go
to Holland for ordination; this was a great
expense, and often kept congregations without
a minister for a long time. The entire
discipline of the church—all the Courts of
Appeal—was also in the Fatherland.</p>

<p>In order to obtain relief from the last-named
hampering condition, a few ministers
in America devised a plan, in 1737, to secure
church-organization in New York. It took
the slow-moving Classis of Amsterdam ten
years to signify approval of this plan, and a
body was formed, named the Cœtus. But
this had merely advisory powers, and in less
than ten years it asked to be constituted a
Classis with full ecclesiastical powers. From
this step arose a violent and bitter quarrel,
which lasted fifteen years,—until 1771,—between
the Cœtus party, the Reformers, and
the Conferentie party, the Conservatives.
The permission of the Classis of Amsterdam
for American church independence was finally
given on condition of establishing a college
for the proper training of the ministry of the
Dutch Reformed church. The Cœtus party
obtained a charter from George III. for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
college, which, called Queens College, was
blighted in its birth by the Revolution, but
lived with varying prosperity until its successful
revival, under the name of Rutgers
College, in 1825.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br><span class="small">“THE END OF HIS DAYS”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As soon as a death had been announced to
the dwellers in any little town in colonial
New York, by the slow ringing or tolling of
the church-bell, there went forth solemnly
from his home the <i>aanspreecker</i>, or funeral-inviter
(who might be grave-digger, bell-ringer,
schoolmaster, or chorister, and who
was usually all four), attired in gloomy black,
with hat fluttering long streamers of crape;
and with much punctilio he visited all the
relatives and friends of the deceased person,
notified them of the death, advised them of
the day and hour of the funeral, and requested
their honorable presence. This inviting was
a matter of most rigid etiquette; no one in
these Dutch-American communities of slightest
dignity or regard for social proprieties
would attend a funeral unbidden. The <i>aanspreecker</i>
was paid at regular rates for his
service as living perambulating obituary notice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
according to the distance travelled and
the time spent, if he lived in a country town
where distances between houses were great.</p>

<p>In 1691 the “inviters to the buryiall of deceased
persons” in New York were public
officers, appointed and licensed by the Mayor.
Their names were Conradus Vanderbeck and
Richard Chapman, and they were bidden to
give their attendance gratis to the poor. A
law was passed in New York in 1731, setting
the fees of “inviters to funerals” at eighteen
shillings for the funeral of any one over
twenty years of age; for a person between
twelve and twenty years, twelve shillings; for
one under twelve years, eight shillings. For
a large circle of friends these sums seem
small. The Flatbush inviter in 1682 had
twelve guilders for inviting to the funeral of
a grown person, and only four guilders in
addition if he invited in New York,—which
was poor pay enough, when we think of the
long ride and the row across. In 1760 we
find the New York inviter, Evert Fels, advertising
his change of residence, and that he
can be found if needed next King’s Stores.
It is easy to imagine that the <i>aanspreecker</i>
must have been a somewhat self-important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
personage, who doubtless soberly enjoyed
his profession of mortuary news-purveyor,
and who must have been greeted wherever
he went with that grewsome interest which
in colonial days attached to everything pertaining
to death.</p>

<p>This public officer and custom was probably
derived from the Romans, who used to
send a public crier about, inviting the people
to the solemnization of a funeral. In the
northern counties of England each village
had its regular “bidder,” who announced his
“funeral-bidding” by knocking on each door
with a great key. Sometimes he “cried” the
funeral through the town with a hand-bell.
In New York the fashion was purely of Dutch
derivation. In Holland the <i>aanspreecker</i> was
an official appointed by government, and authorized
to invite for the funerals of persons
of all faiths and denominations who chanced
to die in his parish.</p>

<p>In New York, ever bent on fashions new,
the <i>aanspreecker</i>, on mournful mission intent,
no longer walks our city avenues nor even
our country lanes or village streets; but in
Holland he still is a familiar form. Not, as of
old, the honored schoolmaster, but simply a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
hired servant of the undertaker, he rushes
with haste through the streets of Dutch
towns. Still clad in dingy black of ancient
fashion, kneebreeches, buckled shoes, long
cloak, cocked hat with long streamers of
crape, he seems the sombre ghost of old-time
manners. Sometimes he bears written
invitations deep bordered with black; sometimes
he calls the death and time of funeral,
as did the Roman <i>præco</i>; and sometimes, with
streamers of white, and white cockade on his
hat, he goes on a kindred duty,—he bears to
a circle of friends or relatives the news of a
birth.</p>

<p>Before the burial took place, in olden times,
a number of persons, usually intimate friends
of the dead, watched the body throughout
the night. Liberally supplied with various
bodily comforts, such as abundant strong
drink, plentiful tobacco and pipes, and newly
baked cakes, these watchers were not wholly
gloomy, nor did the midnight hours lag unsolaced.
The great <i>kamer</i> in which the body
lay, the state-room of the house, was an
apartment so rarely used on other occasions
than a funeral that in many households it was
known as the <i>doed-kamer</i>, or dead-room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Sometimes it had a separate front door by
which it was entered, thus giving two front
doors to the house. Diedrich Knickerbocker
says the front door of New York houses was
never opened save for funerals, New Years, and
such holidays. The kitchen door certainly
offered a more cheerful welcome. In North
Holland the custom still exists of reserving
a room with separate outside entrance, for
use for weddings and funerals. Hence the
common saying in Holland that doors are not
made for going in and out of the house.</p>

<p>Men and women both served as watchers,
and sometimes both were at the funeral services
within the <i>doed-kamer</i>; but when the
body was borne to the grave on the wooden
bier resting on the shoulders of the chosen
bearers, it was followed by men only. The
women remained for a time in the house
where the funeral had taken place, and ate
<i>doed-koecks</i> and sipped Madeira wine.</p>

<p>The coffin, made of well-seasoned boards,
was often covered with black cloth. Over it
was spread the <i>doed-kleed</i>, a pall of fringed
black cloth. This <i>doed-kleed</i> was the property
of the church, as was the pall in New England
churches, and was usually stored with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
the bier in the church-vestibule, or <i>doop-huys</i>.
In case of a death in childbirth, a heavy
white sheet took the place of the black pall.
This practice also obtained in Yorkshire,
England.</p>

<p>Among the Dutch a funeral was a most
costly function. The expenditure upon funeral
gloves, scarfs, and rings, which was universal
in New England, was augmented in New
York by the gift of a bottle of wine and a
linen scarf.</p>

<p>When Philip Livingstone died, in 1749, his
funeral was held both in New York and at
the Manor. He had lived in Broad Street,
and the lower rooms of his house and those
of his neighbors were thrown open to receive
the assemblage. A pipe of wine was spiced
for the guests, and the eight bearers were
each given a pair of gloves, a mourning-ring,
a scarf, handkerchief, and a monkey-spoon.
At the Manor a similar ceremony took place,
and a pair of gloves and handkerchief were
given to each tenant. The whole expense
was five hundred pounds. When Madam
Livingstone died, we find her son writing to
New York from the Manor for a piece of
black Strouds to cover the four hearse-horses;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
for a “Barrell of Cutt Tobacco and Long
Pipes of which I am out;” for six silver
tankards and cinnamon for the burnt wine;
he said he had bottles, decanters, and glasses
enough. The expense of these funerals
may have been the inspiration for William
Livingstone’s paper on extravagance in
funerals.</p>

<p>A monkey-spoon was a handsome piece of
silver bearing the figure or head of an ape on
the handle. <i>Mannetiens</i> spoons, also used in
New Netherland, were similar in design. At
the funeral of Henry De Forest, an early
resident of New Harlem in 1637, his bearers
were given spoons.</p>

<p>A familiar and extreme example of excess
at funerals as told by Judge Egbert Benson
was at the obsequies of Lucas Wyngaard, an
old bachelor who died in Albany in 1756.
The attendance was very large, and after the
burial a large number of the friends of the
dead man returned to the house, and literally
made a night of it. These sober Albany citizens
drank up a pipe of wine, and smoked
many pounds of tobacco. They broke hundreds
of pipes and all the decanters and
glasses in the house, and wound up by burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
all their funeral scarfs in a heap in the
fireplace.</p>

<p>In Albany the expense, as well as the rioting,
of funerals seems to have reached a climax.
It is said that the obsequies of the
first wife of Hon. Stephen Van Rensselaer
cost twenty thousand dollars. Two thousand
linen scarfs were given, and all the tenants
were entertained for several days.</p>

<p>On Long Island every young man of good
family began in his youth to lay aside money
in gold coin to pay for his funeral; and a
superior stock of wine was also saved for the
same occasion. In Albany the cask of choice
Madeira which was bought for a wedding and
used in part, was saved in remainder for the
funeral of the bridegroom.</p>

<p>The honor of a lavish funeral was not given
to the wealthy and great and distinguished
only. The close of every life, no matter how
humble, how unsuccessful, was through the
dignity conferred by death afforded a triumphal
exit by the medium of “a fine
burying.”</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter the funeral of a
penniless Albanian is noted; in 1696 Ryseck
Swart also became one of the church-poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
of Albany. She was not wholly penniless;
she had a little silver and a few petty jewels,
and a little strip of pasture land, worth in all
about three hundred guilders. These she
transferred to the church, for the Consistory
to take charge of and dole out to her. A
good soul, Marritje Lievertse, was from
that time paid by the church thirty-six
guilders a month for caring for Ryseck. I
do not doubt she had tender care, for she
was the last of the real church-poor (soon
they had paupers and an almshouse), and
she lived four years, and cost the parish two
thousand two hundred and twenty-nine guilders.
She died on February 15, 1700, and,
though a pauper, she departed this life
neither unwept, unhonored, nor unsung.
Had she been the cherished wife of a
burgomaster or <i>schepen</i>, she could scarce
have had a more fully rounded or more
proper funeral. The bill, which was paid
by the church, was as follows:—</p>

<p>Rosenboom, for many years the <i>voor-leeser</i>
and <i>dood-graver</i> and <i>aanspreecker</i> in Albany,
sent in a bill of twelve guilders for delivering
invitations to the funeral,—which bill was
rejected by the deacons as exorbitant. But
the invitations were delivered just the same,
for even colonial paupers had friends, and her
coffin was not made of green wood held
together with wooden pegs, which some poor
bodies had to endure; and the one hundred
and fifty <i>doed-koecks</i> and Madeira for the
women very evenly balanced the plentiful
beer and wine and tobacco for the men.
Truly, to quote one of Dyckman’s letters
from Albany, “the poor’s purse here was
richly garnisht.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>An account of Albany, written by a traveller
thereto in 1789, showed the continued existence
of these funeral customs. It runs
thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their funeral customs are equally singular.
None attend them without a previous invitation.
At the appointed hour they meet at the neighboring
houses or stoops until the corpse is brought out.
Ten or twelve persons are appointed to take the
bier altogether, and are not relieved. The clerk
then desires the gentlemen (for ladies never walk
to the grave, nor even attend the funeral unless a
near relation) to fall into the procession. They go
to the grave and return to the house of mourning
in the same order. Here the tables are handsomely
set and furnished with cold and spiced wine, tobacco
and pipes, and candles, paper, etc., to light them.
The house of mourning is soon converted into a
house of feasting.”</p>
</div>

<p>In New York we find old citizens leaving
directions in their wills that their funeral shall
be conducted in “the old Dutch fashion,”
not liking the comparatively simpler modern
modes.</p>

<p>The customs were nearly the same in
English families. At the funeral of Hon.
Rufus King at Jamaica, Long Island, in 1827,
which was held upon an exceptionally hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
day in April, silver salvers holding decanters
of wine and spirits, glasses and cigars, were
constantly passed, both indoors and out,
where many stood waiting the bearing of
the coffin to the grave.</p>

<p>The transition of the funeral customs of
ante-Revolutionary days into those of our
own may partially be learned from this
account written in 1858 by Rev. Peter Van
Pelt, telling Domine Schoonmaker’s method
of conducting a funeral in the year 1819:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The deceased had, many years before, provided
and laid away the materials for his own
coffin. This one was of the best seasoned and
smoothest boards and beautifully grained. As I
entered the room I observed the coffin elevated
on a table in one corner. The Domine, abstracted
and grave, was seated at the upper end; and
around in solemn silence, the venerable and hoary-headed
friends of the deceased. A simple recognition
or a half-audible inquiry as one after another
arrived was all that passed. Directly the sexton,
followed by a servant, made his appearance with
glasses and decanters. Wine was handed to each.
Some declined; others drank a solitary glass.
This ended, again the sexton presented himself
with pipes and tobacco. The Domine smoked
his pipe and a few followed his example. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
custom has become obsolete, and it is well that
it has. When the whiffs of smoke had ceased
to curl around the head of the Domine, he arose
with evident feeling, and in a quiet subdued tone,
made a short but apparently impressive address.
I judged solely by his appearance and manner;
for although boasting a Holland descent, it was
to me an unknown tongue. A short prayer concluded
the service; and then the sexton taking
the lead, followed the Domine, doctor, and pall-bearers
with white scarfs and black gloves. The
corpse and long procession of friends and neighbors
proceeded to the churchyard.”</p>
</div>

<p>Not only were materials for the coffin secured
and made ready during the lifetime,
but often a shroud was made and kept for
use. Instances have been known where a
shroud was laid by unused for so many years
that it became too yellow and discolored to
use at all, and was replaced by another.
Sometimes a new unlaundered shirt was laid
aside for years to use as a <i>doed-hemde</i>. Two
curious superstitions were rife in some localities,
especially on Long Island; one was the
careful covering of all the mirrors in the
house, from the time of the death till after
the funeral; the other the pathetically picturesque
“telling the bees.” Whittier’s gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
rhyme on the subject has made familiar to
modern readers the custom of “telling the
bees of one, gone on the journey we all must
go.”</p>

<p>Both an English and Dutch funeral fashion
was the serving to the attendants of the
funeral of funeral-cakes. In New York and
New Netherland these were a distinctive
kind of <i>koeckje</i> known as <i>doed-koecks</i>, literally
dead-cakes. An old receipt for their manufacture
is thus given by Mrs. Ferris: “Fourteen
pounds of flour, six pounds of sugar,
five pounds of butter, one quart of water,
two teaspoonfuls of pearlash, two teaspoonfuls
of salt, one ounce of Caraway seed. Cut
in thick dishes four inches in diameter.”
They were, therefore, in substance much like
our New Year’s cakes. Sometimes they were
marked with the initials of the deceased
person; and often they were carried home
and kept for years as a memento of the dead,—perhaps
of the pleasures of the funeral.
One baker in Albany made a specialty of
these cakes, but often they were baked at
home. Sometimes two of these <i>doed-koecks</i>
were sent with a bottle of wine and a pair of
gloves as a summons to the funeral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>In Whitby, England, a similar cake is still
made by bakers and served at funerals; but
it is sprinkled with white sugar. In Lincolnshire
and Cumberland like customs still exist.
“Burial-cakes” were advertised by a baker
in 1748 in the Philadelphia newspapers.</p>

<p>It is frequently asserted that funeral rings
were commonly given among the Dutch.
It seems fair to infer that more of them
would have been in existence to-day if the
custom had been universal. Scores of them
can be found in New England. There is an
enamelled ring marked “K. V. R., obit Sept.
16, 1719,” which was given at the funeral of
Kileaen Van Renssalaer. One of the Earl
of Bellomont is also known, and two in the
Lefferts family, dating towards the close of
the past century. I have heard of a few others
in Hudson Valley towns. Perhaps with gifts
of gloves, spoons, bottles of wine, <i>doed-koecks</i>,
scarfs, or handkerchiefs, rings would have
been superfluous.</p>

<p>It will be noted in all these references to
funerals herein given that the services were
held in private houses; it was not until almost
our own day that the funerals of those
of Dutch descent were held in the churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>Interments were made under the churches;
and, by special payment, a church-attendant
could be buried under the seat in which he
was wont to sit during his lifetime. The cost
of interment in the Flatbush church was two
pounds for the body of a child under six
years; three pounds for a person from six
to sixteen years of age; four pounds for an
adult; and in addition “those who are inclined
to be permitted to be interred in the
church are required to pay the expense of
every person.” I don’t know exactly what
this ambiguous sentence can mean, but it
was at any rate an extra charge “for the
profit of the schoolmaster,” who dug the
grave and carried the dirt out of the church,
and was paid twenty-seven guilders for this
sexton’s work for an adult, and less for a
younger person and hence a smaller grave.
Usually the domines were buried in front of
the pulpit where they had stood so often in life.</p>

<p>After newspaper-days arrived in the colony,
there blossomed in print scores of long death-notices,
thoroughly in the taste of the day,
but not to our taste. In the “New York
Gazette” of December 24, 1750, we find a
characteristic one:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Last Friday Morning departed this Life after a
lingering Illness the Honorable Mrs. Roddam, wife

<p>The tiresome, pompous, verbose productions,
Johnsonian in phrase and fulsome in
sentiment, which effloresced on the death of
any man in public life or of great wealth,
need not be repeated here. They were monotonously
devoid of imagination and originality,
being full of idle repetitions from each
other, and whoever has labored through one
can judge of them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>It does not give us a very exalted notion
of the sincerity or value of these funeral
testimonials, or the mental capacity of our
ancestors, to read in the newspapers advertisements
of printed circulars of praise for
the dead, eulogistic in every aspect of the
life of the departed, and suitable for various
ages and either sex, to be filled in with the
name of the deceased, his late residence, and
date of death.</p>

<p>Puttenham in the “Arte of English Poesie,”
says: “An Epitaph is an inscription such as
a man may commodiously write or engrave
vpon a tombe in few verses, pithie, quicke,
and sententious, for the passer-by to peruse
and judge vpon without any long tariaunce.”</p>

<p>There need be no “long tariaunce” for
either inquisitive or irreverent search over
the tombstones of the Dutch, for the dignified
and simple inscriptions are in marked
contrast to the stilted affectations, the verbose
enumerations, the pompous eulogies,
which make many English “graveyard lines”
a source of ridicule and a gratification of
curiosity. Indeed, the Dutch inscriptions
can scarcely be called epitaphs; the name,
date of birth and death, are simply prefaced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
with the ever-recurring <i>Hier rust het lighaam</i>,
Here rests the body; <i>Hier leydt het stoffelyk
deel</i>, Here lie the earthly remains; or simpler
still, <i>Hier leyt begraven</i>, Here lies buried.
Sometimes is found the touching <i>Gedach-tenis</i>,
In remembrance. More impressive
still, from its calm repetition on stone after
stone, of an undying faith in a future life,
are the ever-present words, <i>In den Heere
ontslapen</i>, Sleeping in the Lord.</p>

<p>Not only in memory of those dead-and-gone
colonists stand these simple Dutch
tombstones, but in suggestive remembrance
also of a language forever passed away from
daily life in this land. The lichened lettering
of those unfamiliar words seems in sombre
truth the very voice of those honored dead
who, in those green Dutch graveyards, in
the shadow of the old Dutch churches, <i>in
den Heere ontslapen</i>.
